  "longDescription": "<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;SzVdkX9wtTQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">TRAILER</a></p><p><br /></p><p>One of the differences between indie games and AAA games is the sound and especially the gun sounds and this is because, as a sound engineer, it is much harder to achieve a great sound for the gunshots than for anything else. The problem with the gunshots is that if you simply record them, the gunshots will not sound amazing, it doesn&#39;t matter how good or expensive are the microphones you are using to record the sounds. First of all, you will need at least 3 or 4 microphones but some engineers are using up to 10 microphones to record a single gunshot from different perspectives. All those perspectives have to be mixed together, digitally processed (equalized, filtered, mastered) and after hours of work per sound, you will get the satisfying punchy and powerful sound you expect.</p><p><br /></p><p>This UE5 pack contains 330 high quality sounds carefully designed to take your game to the next level. There are 66 different guns and each gun comes with 5 different sounds. All those different sounds per weapon, together with a random playing system and a sound concurrency setup, gives the player a feeling of authenticity and realism (because every time the player fires, there is a different combination of sounds being played). The pack comes with a basic automatic fire system and because of the ingenious combination between random sounds and sound concurrency setup, you will not need any loops to achieve realistic automatic fire for all guns.</p><p><br /></p><p>I tried o offer as much variety as possible, so there are gunshots with long tail, specific to exterior and there are also gunshots with small tail specific to closed spaces. From this point of view, the sound effects can be very useful for open world games but also for games where actions takes place indoor.</p><p><br /></p><p>Are you tired of gunshots that sound like toys? If this is the case, this pack is exactly what you need...</p><p><br /></p><p>Check my other packs <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/Mathew81?count&#61;20&amp;sortBy&#61;effectiveDate&amp;sortDir&#61;DESC&amp;start&#61;0\" rel=\"nofollow\">HERE</a></p>",
