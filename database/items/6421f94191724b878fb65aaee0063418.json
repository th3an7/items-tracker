  "longDescription": "<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/hNcUJ6F224g\" rel=\"nofollow\">Demonstration</a></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/rlhAWmhkzgU\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quick Setup Guide and Controls</a></p><p><a href=\"https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/the-hand-unit-interaction-and-selection-component-help-and-request-thread/1626819\" rel=\"nofollow\">Epic Forums: Help and Request Thread</a></p><p><br /></p><p>The Hand: Unit Interaction and Selection Component is a ready-to-use component that will enable you to interact with and select units in your projects! On a new template project you can get started in less than 2 minutes, all you have to do is change the default Player Controller and HUD. For selection, The Hand has single unit selection, select by type, and rectangular selection (marquee select) with basic move-to command. The Hand allows you to pick up skeletal mesh units and interactable objects, with a &#34;shake unit&#34; feature that enables you to shake a unit to trigger an event of your making. The Hand also includes ragdoll physics when dropping or throwing skeletal mesh units and allows the units to recover to standing position, just add your own stand-up animation montage to smooth the transition. I also added a rigged 3D model of a gauntlet surgically removed from Greystone of Paragon fame as a bonus. Perfect for top-down RTS, colony sim, base builders, and more, add The Hand: Unit Interaction and Selection Component to your projects to unlock new mechanics and features in your games!</p>",
