Each sphere defines by how much the camera arm length should be multiplied. We only use the biggest sphere that has an enemy inside.</li><li><strong>Continuous - </strong>This mode maps the distance to the furthest enemy to define the value the Arm Length Multiplier; i.e., you can make it so that the further you are from enemies, the further/closer the camera gets to the player. On top of that, this can be mapped onto a curve to define how much the multiplier accelerates/decelerates.</li><li><strong>Dynamic - </strong>This mode will decrease the camera Arm Length when all of the enemies are visible and increase it when they get behind the player&#39;s back.</li><li><strong>Additive Arm Length Methods</strong></li><li><strong>Tags - </strong>Does your game have huge enemies? The Tag Mappings’ additive arm length method in DCC allow you to setup tags on your enemies to dynamically increase/decrease the distance of the camera without having to create another camera system.</li><li><strong>Screen Edge - </strong>Do your players struggle with ambushes from behind? This method allows the camera to <strong>✨dynamically adapt</strong>✨ to the enemies at the edges of the screen to <strong>always keep them visible!</strong></li><li><strong>Combine any one Multiplier with any set of Additive methods!</strong></li></ul>",
