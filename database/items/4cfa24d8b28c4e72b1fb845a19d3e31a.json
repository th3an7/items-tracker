Narrative Interaction is created by Reuben Ward aka Reubs, a developer with over a decade of Unreal Engine experience and a YouTube dev community of over 400,000 subscribers. If Narrative Interaction doesn&#39;t work for your game, a refund can be provided.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>A POWERFUL INTERACTION SYSTEM</strong></p><p>Great on its own or with other Narrative Plugins, Narrative Interaction provides rich, multiplayer-ready interaction for your game. Open doors, Loot Chests, Talk to NPCs - anything your game requires. Because the UI leverages Narrative Common UI - Narrative Interaction works great on any platform - whether you&#39;re shipping your game for PC, Xbox, PS5, or Switch. It just works.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>INTEGRATES WITH ALL YOUR NARRATIVE TOOLS </strong></p><p>Narrative Interaction is excellent on its own - but where it really steals the show is how it improves the rest of your Narrative Tools.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Using Narrative Inventory?</strong> <strong>You&#39;ll get:</strong></p><ul><li>Interactable Lootable containers, with the option to be locked, or require an item such as a key to open them.</li><li>Interactable item pickups that tell you if you can&#39;t take them for any reason, for example if your Inventory is full.</li></ul><p><br /></p><p><strong>Using Narrative 3? You&#39;ll get:</strong></p><ul><li>Press a Button to talk to your NPCs, and be informed if an NPC doesn&#39;t have anything to say at the moment.</li><li>Have a Quest Task where you have to Interact with something, for example &#34;Open the Door&#34;</li></ul><p><br /></p><p><strong>MADE FOR ANY PROJECT </strong></p><p>Most systems on the marketplace look flashy and great, but in practise are a nightmare to use. They often require you to use their entire unreal project and build your game on top of it - not very practical.</p><p><br /></p><p>Because Narrative tools are all built as Plugins, you can drop them into any game, even if you started your project months ago. Narrative tools are built by real game developers and we&#39;re not interested in just making flashy looking plugins - we actually really care about making them easy to use.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>FEELS JUST LIKE UNREAL ENGINE</strong></p><p>No scary new systems to learn - add an Interaction component to the actor you want to be able to interact with, customize its settings to your liking, and define what it should do with the On Interact event.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>BUILT IN UI</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t waste time making your own Interaction UI, our expert UI designer has created a full interaction menu that works with the Interaction system right out of the box. Its also very easy to modify to your tastes.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>ALL THE SUPPORT YOU NEED</strong></p><p>Narrative Interaction is a powerful system but don&#39;t worry - there is a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VDCu9ulTaJc\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quick Start Guide</a> to help you get set up. Still need more help? Narrative has a active community of 1000&#43; customers on <a href=\"https://redirect.epicgames.com/?redirectTo&#61;https://redirect.epicgames.com/?redirectTo&#61;https://discord.gg/qyVJmpQ2Pn\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a>, with staff around every day to provide answers.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>MULTIPLAYER/ONLINE SUPPORT</strong></p><p>Narrative Interaction has networking built right in. You don&#39;t have to do a thing, we&#39;ve already handled all the networking code.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>EASILY CUSTOMIZABLE</strong></p><p>We&#39;ve all tried bloated plugins that offer hundreds of features, only to realize when we try add them to our games that these bloated plugins actually make development harder! Narrative understands that every game is different and instead makes extensibility the top priority, meaning Narrative will work for any game.</p>",
