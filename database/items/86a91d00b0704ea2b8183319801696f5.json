  "longDescription": "<p>Viewport Utilities defines mapping between:</p><ul><li>players and devices (the physical controllers)</li><li>players and split-screen parts</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>What it means is that you can:</p><ul><li>Control more player controllers with the same device, for example in a split-screen racing game with one player using ADWS, the other controlling with the arrows.</li><li>Have more active player controllers for turn-based games, with always the currently active player visible on the screen, and only this player getting input from the device (like keyboard).</li><li>Create a Lego-style proximity-based splitscreen, so that if the players are near, then splitscreen is turned off, otherwise splitscreen is enabled.</li><li>And many other things!</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>We only actively update the package for the most recent UE4 version (but of course we provide e-mail support for older versions too). UE5 support is not planned at this point.</p>",
