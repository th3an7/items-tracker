  "longDescription": "<p>Please listen to this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;yI6Br_yPL_4\" rel=\"nofollow\">DEMO</a> to hear all the SFX included in this pack.</p><p><br /></p><p>Futuristic Gunshots contains 280 gunshot sound effects specially created for science fiction weapons.  The pack contains also a basic setup for automatic fire and a sound concurrency rule, so the sounds will not excessively overlap (very useful especially for very high fire rate or for the sounds with a long tail). Because of this, there is no need for loops and the automatic fire uses only single shots. The sound effects can be very useful for open world games but also for games where actions takes place indoor. The pack comes with a modified First Person Blueprint, where I implemented automatic fire and a system to change the weapon sound during the gameplay (pressing the keys &#34;1&#34; and &#34;2&#34; ,the player can move forward and backward through the list of gunshot sci-fi / futuristic sound effects)</p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features:</p><p><br /></p><ul><li> High quality stereo sounds</li><li> No need for loop sounds (a combination of sound concurrency setup, random single shots and automatic fire system make automatic fire realistic so there is no need of using audio loops)</li><li> Professionally mixed and mastered</li></ul><p>Number of Audio Waves: 280</p><p>Number of Audio Cues: 280</p><p>Sample rate / bit rate: 44100 Hz</p><p>Do Sound FX loop: No</p><p>Minutes of audio provided:</p><p>Supported Development Platforms:</p><p>Windows: Yes</p><p>Mac: Yes</p><p><br /></p><p>Documentation: All you need to know in order to test the sound effects is written as text inside the Demo Level:</p><p><br /></p><ol><li>Press Left Mouse Button to fire the current gunshot sound effect</li><li>Use the keys &#34;1&#34; or &#34;2&#34; to change the current gunshot sfx</li><li>Hold Left Mouse Button for automatic fire</li></ol><p><br /></p><p>Important/Additional Notes: For those who want to change the fire rate of the weapons, in the First Person Character Blueprint there is a variable called: Firerate, which now has a value of 0.08. Increase or decrease that number to get different fire rates. This pack contains only gunshot sound effects (no reloading, cocking, etc. )</p><p><br /></p><p>If you like this pack, feel free to write a review and rate it. This will keep me motivated to create better and better assets. Thank you!</p><p><br /></p>",
