This is Totsnuk&#39;s Junkbox! You get what you get and that&#39;s it!</strong></h2><p><br /></p><p>---</p><p><em>*You wander into the goblin tinkerer&#39;s shop.*</em></p><p><strong>You: Can I peruse your wares?</strong></p><p><em>*He hands you a shiny red box with what looks to be a mound of junk and garbage, but with your magic you observe some gleaming treasures underneath!*</em></p><p><strong>That&#39;ll be 10 silver coins. Now bugger off, I&#39;ve got some tinkerin&#39; to do!</strong></p><p>---</p><p><br /></p><h3><strong>General Info</strong></h3><p><br /></p><p><strong>This is a Music and SFX asset pack that is themed to whatever I happened to want to make at the time (Hey buddy, that means it&#39;s good. Anything you make with love is good, right?! Right??).</strong></p><p><br /></p><h3><strong>Track Info</strong></h3><p><br /></p><p>14 tracks with variants that have the reverb tail.</p><p>5 ambient, 4 battle, 3 chill, 1 shop, and 1 town</p><p>I&#39;d say some of the ambient/chill tracks could be substituted as battle themes.</p><p>A lot of the battle tracks have heavy jungle/DnB influence. There are a couple chiptune&#39;y tracks, as well as some ambient and drone music. Oh, also funk too. Lots of funk.</p><p><br /></p><h3><strong>Documentation and Demos</strong></h3><p><br /></p><p>Full track and SFX list is on the PDF. The document includes the Type, Genre, Name, BPM, and Time Signature of all tracks. SFX are just under the SFX type.</p><p>You can listen to all of them individually on <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/totmusic2/sets/totsnuks-junkbox-vol-1/s-GoACKyeLWtS?si&#61;408c1f53bdc54c82ab5a415c184bf60e&amp;utm_source&#61;clipboard&amp;utm_medium&#61;text&amp;utm_campaign&#61;social_sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Soundcloud</a>.</p><p>Note that the SFX are not entirely thematic and are mostly a bonus to this mostly mostly music oriented pack.</p><p>Did I say the word mostly enough?</p><p>Also, the art was made by yours truly :B</p><p><br /></p><p>---</p><p>*You try to loosen one of the letters on the sign with a spell*</p><p><strong>HEY DON&#39;T TAKE MY SIGN, YA BLOODY THIEF!</strong></p><p>*He throws another junkbox at you that hits you directly on the forehead and for a moment you see a gold coin fly out of it, that is... before you black out*</p><p>---</p><p><br /></p><h3><strong>Other Info</strong></h3><p><br /></p><p><strong>Please contact me at my email with any questions or feedback, I will respond as fast as I can - totmusicbusiness&#64;gmail.com</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://totsnuk.carrd.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Other links</a></p>",
