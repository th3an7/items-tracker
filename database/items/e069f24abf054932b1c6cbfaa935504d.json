  "description": "A collection of modular burlap & fabric sacks with swappable contents of apples, grains and potatoes.",
  "longDescription": "<p>Video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/WycfRPoCBp4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/WycfRPoCBp4</a></p><p><br /></p><p>Nanite is enabled on the Sacks and Fruit by default in UE5</p><p><br /></p><p>This pack contains 4 physically accurate burlap sacks, originally created with a cloth simulation to achieve a fully realistic look and baked down to a static mesh for performance (Just to clarify, these are not dynamic cloth sims).</p><p><br /></p><p>Note that these start as high poly, high res models. They have LODs which you can clamp if you do not need the full resolution, and the same goes for the textures. The aim was to be very scalable across different platforms</p><p><br /></p><p>There are 2 fabric variants (a light and dark which are burlap and fabric textured) on the sack material and it can be further tinted as needed. The different sacks contain different options of grains, potatoes, or apples. The grains have 8 variations, and the apples come in red and green. Also included is a easy to use blueprint to quickly randomise placement. You just need to drag the blueprint in, and it will randomly choose a pairing of sack, contents and material. The blueprint contains instance override controls for the ratio of light/dark sacks, a bool to refresh the seeded random, and the option to auto-rotate in the Z-axis for added variation. All randoms are driven by a seed so it will be predictable at runtime.</p><p><br /></p><p>All sacks are designed to be free standing on the floor. All meshes contain collisions, and have generated LODâ€™s for better performance. All textures are power of 2 and will mipmap cleanly. These come with high resolution textures, so you may wish to limit the mipmap if targeting lower end devices.</p><p><br /></p><p>An Individual apple mesh and potato mesh are included if you wish to scatter extras yourself.</p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features:</p><ul><li>PBR Materials</li><li>Realistic look, generated from dynamic cloth simulations and converted to static meshes</li><li>LOD and Mipmaps should provide scalable performance for any platform.</li><li>Placement blueprint allows for quickly placing in scene while randomising result with a seed.</li><li>4 sacks, with 2 colors, 10 contents, 1 with 1 variation, so 11 contents total, provides 88 random variations.</li></ul><p>Texture Sizes: (please list resolutions for each texture)</p><ul><li>Sacks (Diffuse, Packed Roughness &amp; Metallic, Normal) 2048x2048</li><li>Grains (Diffuse, Normal) 512x512 (Tileable)</li><li>Apple - (Diffuse, Normal) 1024x1024</li><li>Potato - (Diffuse, Normal) 1024x1024</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Collision: Yes (automatically generated)</p><p>Vertex Count: Around 30k per bag, but optimises extremely well with provided LOD&#39;s. Around 4k on Lowest LOD. </p><p>Feel free to delete higher LODs if you do not need the highest quality. </p><p>LODs: Unreal LOD Generated</p><p>Number of Meshes: 14</p><p>Number of Materials and Material Instances: 4 Materials, 26 Instances</p><p>Number of Textures: 46</p><p><br /></p><p>Supported Development Platforms: (Tested on Win64, should work on all platforms)</p><p>Supported Target Build Platforms: (Tested on Win64, should work on all platforms)</p><p><br /></p><p>Important/Additional Notes:</p><p>All meshes have hand made lightmap UV&#39;s, however the apples and potatoes, being a collection of separate meshes combined, do not always bake well on default lightmass settings with low resolution lightmaps. You may wish to set them to movable if you are unable to up the lightmass quality / resolution. They work perfectly in dynamic light.</p>",
