And if you have other trees in the forest and even bushes with berries and also want berries or fruits to spawn nearby.</p><p>Or if you have a game about survival in an urban environment and you want a bottle of water or food to appear near a pile of garbage or on a table with a certain chance. All this will help to do Foliage Assistant. With Foliage Assistant, you have full control over the appearance of such objects.</p><p><br /></p><p>Foliage Assistant is a great tool for creating support for your static meshes. It can work with Foliage Instance, Procedural Foliage Volume, and any static mesh placed in your world. The system keeps track of all static meshes around your character or any actor and spawns next to the static mesh of the actors you need. You can create lists of what you need to spawn, set the spawn chance.</p><p> The system also transmits the spawn time for your actor, so you can easily do things like rotting food. Respawn, Save and Load the whole state is supported. Lists with settings for each actor you want to spawn.</p><p><br /></p><p> Foliage Assistant uses a powerful optimization algorithm - there is no difference between 100 items or 100 million.</p><p> Foliage Assistant divides the whole world into sectors and works only with those sectors that are currently active. Multiplayer supported. All calculations are done on the server side. Foliage Assistant is great for games with large maps</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Basic features:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Foliage Assistant uses a powerful optimization algorithm - there is no difference between 100 items or 100 million.</strong></li><li><strong>Work with World Composition with World Origin Rebasing</strong></li><li><strong>Multiplayer support.</strong></li><li><strong>All calculations take place on the server-side.</strong></li><li><strong>The system for saving and loading the state of the Foliage Assistant.</strong></li><li><strong>For example, if you decide to add a new fruit or a bottle of water to the spawn for your world, now you can do it in 2 clicks.</strong></li><li><strong>The code is written in C&#43;&#43; to improve performance.
