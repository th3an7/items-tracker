  "longDescription": "<p>This map is a scaled version of real mars DEM data. Textures are also taken from high resolution satellite images. The concept consists of building a remake of its main features, without being boring or unplayable. Note: V1a and V1b share the same materials, they only differ in the elevation models.</p><p><br /></p><p>Original sources were published by the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and can be found in the following Links:</p><p><a href=\"https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Mars/Topography/HRSC_MOLA_Blend/Mars_HRSC_MOLA_BlendDEM_Global_200mp_v2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Mars/Topography/HRSC_MOLA_Blend/Mars_HRSC_MOLA_BlendDEM_Global_200mp_v2</a></p><p><a href=\"https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Mars/Viking/MDIM21/Mars_Viking_MDIM21_ClrMosaic_global_232m\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Mars/Viking/MDIM21/Mars_Viking_MDIM21_ClrMosaic_global_232m</a></p><p><br /></p><p>Fourier Transformations, Gdal, other Filters and Technologies, together with Python and accurate Scientific Data, have been used to work out our own software. This Software has been improving over and over again along the months in which our «Anarchy World» Project was developed. It is very mature now, and is able to glue together hundreds of gigabytes of information, generating textures, normals and elevation data in a way that every pixel and vertex fits perfectly on any scale. It also allowed us to generate hundreds of variations of the terrain model, in a very creative process.</p><p><br /></p><p>Our goals were to make a surface that was mostly navigable, playable and maybe fun to explore. When we watch a real Digital Elevation Model, and especially when it was resized, we can notice lots of spikes and irregular samples taken from different dates along the years. We don’t want a real scale Mars, because most of it is just desert and plains, but is also deep and mystic in some of its areas. Some adjustments need to be made.</p><p><br /></p><p>We want a game map, hundreds of times less extensive, but mountains and terrain perturbations are not meant to be reduced to some meters tall. That’s why this process was so delicate. Once you start to exaggerate the terrain, every single error becomes visible. We want to do that taking care of small details, and that’s where Fourier series come into play.</p><p><br /></p><p>When developing our elevation filters, we take into account some gaming related questions. The map is not only meant to be navigable, with no spots to get stuck on. In a game, we need the map to have Zones, visibly separated, and Paths that connect those areas. There has to be something to explore, and Visibility is key, more places to get lost equals more gameplay, and possibilities.</p><p><br /></p><p>But for a map not to be boring it needs something more, it needs to look big, a good horizon, with layers that allow you to compare what is closest with distant mountains. Those are all things we keep in mind when developing a good Martian Landscape, that can be the foundation of a great game. Not all our goals could be satisfied at the same time, but after a very empirical but necessarily creative process, we are proud of our work.</p><p><br /></p><p>The real deal is the variety of DEM sources you will find with the purchase. The project shows the different sizes of the map with some of its available proportions. It also includes all the textures, and a Suggested Material. This material is just an example, trying to recreate the atmosphere that the author found in his inspiration. You may find it simple, complicated or badly optimized. We encourage you to play with it, and found your own inspiration. Consider it experimental, and a reference. Its main purpose is to prove how everything should look, and leave some hints.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is a project of a more scientific than artistic nature. Anyway, the visual aspect has not been taken lightly, the Textures have also been treated, through different color filters, to achieve a Dark Fantasy style retro aspect. These textures are an IP themselves, that you will not find anywhere else. We are also proud of the final result, and you should not expect more changes. Instead, there are a lot of adjustments you can do with materials.</p><p>* We also suggest some volumetric clouds.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you download this product, you are invited and encouraged to visit our discord server.</p><p>( Hispanohablantes son Especialmente bienvenidos, se buscan Colaboradores )</p><p>DubStar Games: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/VsYz8reGrm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://discord.gg/VsYz8reGrm</a></p><p><br /></p><p>Some Documentation may appear over time and will be Published on that server.
