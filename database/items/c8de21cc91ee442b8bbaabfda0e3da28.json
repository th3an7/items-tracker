  "longDescription": "<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;Jrp91P2eLdI\" rel=\"nofollow\">DEMO</a></p><p>Sci-Fi Punchy Gunshots contains more than 340 gunshot sound effects specially created for science fiction weapons. There are 59 different guns but every bullet sound comes with 3-9 variations (in most of the cases there are 5 variations and in many cases weapons come with 2-5 variations). As you can see in the video, every time the weapon fires, a different sound the weapon is played (which is randomly chosen) so this way the player has a very realistic experience. I have also setup an automatic fire and a sound concurrency rule, so the sounds will not excessively overlap (very useful especially for very high fire rate or for the sounds with a long tail). Because of this, there is no need for loops and the automatic fire uses only single shots. The sound effects can be very useful for open world games but also for games where actions takes place indoor. The pack comes with a modified First Person Blueprint, where I implemented automatic fire and a system to change the weapon sound during the gameplay (pressing the keys &#34;1&#34; and &#34;2&#34; ,the player can move forward and backward through the list of gunshot sci-fi sound effects)</p>",
