Then, your project will enter a powerful building mode, allowing you to use 3 different modes to create anything you desire by using your buildables!</p><p><br /></p><p>BSS offers 3 building modes:</p><p>1.      “<strong>LIBRARY PLACEMENT</strong>” mode.</p><p>Create an unlimited number of buildables (with or without snapping functionality), quick and easy, with the use of database entries and add them to the ten customizable library category tabs.</p><p>Using the “Library Placement” mode and the implemented “material cost system”, place them in your level, in real time, through a variety of tool parameters. There is also a “performance system” per buildable, based on its mesh’s polycount, to help distinguish the low polygon meshes from the high before placing.</p><p>Everything will auto load/save in your designated -per level- save files!</p><p>Your buildables will not be just static meshes but child BP actors with individual coding, breakage sounds and visual effects, if you desire. This means that you can create a window buildable, place it in your level and then open and close it using its own code!</p><p><strong>In detail:</strong></p><p>Ten fully customizable category tabs.</p><p>Unlimited buildables entries per category tab with an auto scroll bar when visible window is full.</p><p>Individual category window widgets for further customization if desired. </p><p>Lightning-fast auto/save functions.</p><p>Very accurate snapping system (for supported buildables).</p><p>Move/rotate buildable on all axes before placing, through a customizable stepping system.</p><p>Detailed information panel for each buildable (name, description, icon, material cost, mesh polycount color, etc.).</p><p>Use the “Crafting materials usage system” to subtract materials needed.</p><p>Use the “Buildable performance indicator system” to inform users about each buildables mesh polycount before placing indicated by five flame colors.</p><p>Customize library window easily through database entries (text, icons, banners, transparency, colors, etc.).</p><p>Center-of-the-screen important information regarding the rotation step setting, buttons functionality, correct or incorrect placement location, and more.</p><p>Easy buildable creation (with or without snapping functionality) through database settings.</p><p> </p><p>2.      “<strong>DETAIL PLACEMENT</strong>” mode.</p><p>With the “Detail Placement” mode, you can select any existing buildable in your level and while in “ghost mode”, see its information in the panel (name, coordinates, polycount info, materials used, etc.) and manipulate its location and rotation with great detail through a customizable stepping system.</p><p>Set or restore its position or even destroy it and recover its crafting materials! Again, save-worry free. Everything is updated and saved instantly and automatically.</p><p><strong>In detail:</strong></p><p>Ghost mode.</p><p>Detailed location adjustment on all axes for already placed buildables in the level, with the stepping amount system.</p><p>Buildable position setup and restoration.</p><p>Auto-save functionality on location/rotation change.</p><p>Detailed information panel.</p><p>A “Buildable performance indicator system” that informs users about each buildables mesh polycount.</p><p>Buildable destruction and recovery of its crafting materials.</p><p>Multi-material support.</p><p>Center-of-the-screen important information regarding the rotation step setting with color designation based on adjustment mode (move or rotate), buttons functionality and more.</p><p><br /></p><p>But there is more! BSS raises the bar by offering a unique functionality!</p><p>3.      “<strong>LAND TOOLS</strong>” mode.</p><p>Land tools allow the creation and removal of pre-existing foliage in your level in real time!</p><p>Two land tools are currently available to cultivate the earth and plant new foliage, through a plethora of options.</p><p>Next time you load your project, your latest foliage level design will be there along with your buildables, making the creation of custom level environments an extremely fast and fun process!</p><p><strong>In detail:</strong></p><p>1.      The “<strong>Caltivator</strong>”.</p><p>Can remove only one type of foliage or all available types through real time settings.</p><p>Restore removed foliages (customizable amount).</p><p>Adjust tool size to affect a larger or smaller area.</p><p>Adjust tool speed to affect its removal force.</p><p>Center-of-the-screen important information regarding the tool’s speed, buttons functionality and more.</p><p>Fast auto load/save.</p><p>Minimum hard drive save file size, by overwriting and not adding any foliage changes in save file.</p><p>2.      The “<strong>Planter</strong>”.</p><p>Plant one or multiple foliages (customizable density).</p><p>Plant random or specific foliage types.</p><p>Foliage preview at the center of the tool.</p><p>Adjust tool size to affect a larger or smaller area.</p><p>Option to follow surface angles on planting.</p><p>Warning messages if placement location is unreachable.</p><p>Change selected foliage&#39;s size and rotation on all axes.</p><p>Center-of-the-screen important information regarding the selected plant’s size, buttons and more.</p><p>Fast auto load/save.</p><p>Minimum hard drive save file size, by overwriting and not adding any foliage changes in save file.</p><p> </p><p><strong>CRAFTING MATERIALS USAGE SYSTEM</strong></p><p>BSS has a material cost system already implemented.</p><p><strong>BUILDABLE PERFORMANCE INDICATOR SYSTEM</strong></p><p>BSS is using a customizable performance system to indicate to the user the possible performance impact of the selected buildable in the level.</p><p><strong>BSS INTERFACE and SETTINGS</strong></p><p>Many BSS settings, (ex. save file names, foliage planting step amount and the restoration amount of already removed foliage) as well as the appearance of the BSS interface, can be customized to your liking.</p><p><strong>GUIDES and SUPPORT</strong></p><p>Detailed comments exist on many of the nodes and an in-depth, 20-page guide, with screenshots and FAQs, are available to use. All variables and functions are organized, with names and descriptions that represent their functionality.</p><p>In addition, customer support for verified customers, is available through email or Discord.</p><p><strong>FUTURE UPDATES</strong></p><p>Many -free for existing BSS owners- BSS updates are planned, including more land tools and additional BSS core functionalities.</p><p> </p><p>Download BSS now and start a new, building included project or raise the level of your existing project even more by adding a unique building and foliage functionality! With “<strong>Building System Supreme</strong>”!</p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p><strong>GENERIC</strong></p><p>Use as base project or implemented in another.</p><p>Performant Child BP buildables (not just 3D meshes) with individual coding.</p><p>Multi-components per buildable.</p><p>3rd and 1st person compatible.</p><p>No C&#43;&#43; knowledge required.</p><p>Performant. No “Event tick” nodes used. (BSS remains dormant when disabled).</p><p>Customizable (save filenames, foliage restoration, interface appearance, etc.).</p><p>Redefinable keys working only in “Building mode” not interfering with other inputs.</p><p>20-page detailed PDF guide with screenshots and FAQs.</p><p>Commented important nodes.</p><p>Error prevention functions for extreme usage (spamming building or deletion keys, etc.).</p><p>Auto Load/Save with notifiers and error preventing functions.</p><p>Warnings for missing components (ex. camera actor).</p><p>Error-free packaged project.</p><p>User friendly. Variables, functions and nodes are categorized and related to their functionality.</p><p>No additional assets needed in level (ex. BP controllers etc.).</p><p>All coding in just one component.</p><p>Usage requirement: Mouse wheel button (for default keys).</p><p>Implementation requirement: A player BP with a camera component.</p><p><strong>NOTES</strong></p><p>-3D assets used in example buildables, are generously available for free from Epic Games.</p><p>-BSS scans your project’s registered foliages in Unreal’s “Foliage” mode and offer them as plants to cultivate or plant. Therefore, an “InstancedFoliageActor” needs to be available in the level for the Land tools to work.</p><p>-The Land tools of BSS V1.0 do not support streaming levels (world partition) or more than one “Instanced Foliage Actor” in a level. Both will be supported in a future release among additional Land tools, free for current BSS owners!</p><p><strong>Happy building!</strong></p>",
