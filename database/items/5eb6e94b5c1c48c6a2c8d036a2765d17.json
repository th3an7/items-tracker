  "longDescription": "<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/fnlqbseN-dQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video</a></p><p>Email: valjr02&#64;gmail.com</p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10WywfWWLtfE-cu_RsEThxCDVxFBvY0Z5?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Demo</a></p><p>This game template includes everything you need to create your own car racing game. You can also create different kinds of racing games (boats, horses, people, planes), since it includes features such as: full gamepad support (for vehicle control and menu interaction), vehicle selection, race countdown logic, checkpoints, determine player places (who’s 1st, 2nd, etc.), lap progress, individual special abilities. Even if you’re planning on creating a different kind of multiplayer game, this template might be of great use since it uses online sessions, remote procedure calls (RPC) functions and replicated variables, all fully documented.</p><p>It starts with a complete menu for hosting or joining a game session. These sessions can be hosted locally or online. This project has the complete setup to use Steam as the online subsystem to host a session.</p><p>Next up is a car selection menu where you choose which car to use in a race. The cars provided are presets but this template project has an easy system to build upon so you can create your own cars and make them selectable in this menu (and playable in any race).</p><p>Races take place in three preset maps, but this project also includes a system for you to make your own race tracks selectable and playable with just a few steps. Although not necessary, you can create your own race tracks by using Epic Games’ Track Generator system, which is included in this project. This system is part of the Blueprints Spline Tracks project, property of Epic Games, which can be obtained for free in the Learn tab of the Epic Games Launcher.</p>",
