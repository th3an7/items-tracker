Whether you&#39;re crafting intricate RPGs or high-octane shooters, n00dArmour offers a comprehensive suite of features to enhance your characters&#39; appearance and functionality.</p><p><br /></p><p>Key Features:</p><ul><li><strong>Comprehensive Modular Implementation:</strong> Supports all three methods of modular implementation: Copy Pose (supports physics and physasset responses), Leader Pose (traces for bones), and Merge Mesh (traces for bone hit). Each method can serve different purposes within your project, such as using merged meshes for NPCs or the player that load when your game loads for optimised variation.</li><li><strong>Full Network Replication:</strong> Ensures all armour data is fully replicated and relevant, providing a consistent experience for all players.</li><li><strong>Optimized Data Handling:</strong> Utilizes data assets for replicated gameplay data, and client-side only data (such as effects or UI textures) for optimized loading on clients with data tables.</li><li><strong>Authoritative Modifiers:</strong> Each armour piece supports multiple authoritative modifiers that can perform any required actions, and are reusable across all armour pieces.</li><li><strong>Tiered Armour Levelling:</strong> Includes levelling support for tiered armour pieces, allowing for progressive upgrades and enhancements.</li><li><strong>Upgradeable and Repairable:</strong> Armour pieces can be upgraded and repaired according to your game rules, offering long-term value and customization.</li><li><strong>Custom Damage Handling:</strong> Features damage handling that redirects to Unreal Engine&#39;s built-in ApplyDamage if no armour is found, with support for custom damage types.</li><li><strong>Well Documented:</strong> Extensive documentation ensures ease of use and comprehensive understanding of the system.</li><li><strong>Simple Integration:</strong> Designed for easy integration, with the complexity handled by the component, making integration a breeze.</li><li><strong>Authoritative and Predictive:</strong> Balances authoritative control where necessary and client predictions for fast gameplay actions.</li><li><strong>Persistence Support:</strong> Supports save game functionality to maintain persistence of armour states.</li><li><strong>Modular and Overlayed Meshes:</strong> Supports both overlayed meshes (meshes on top of the base mesh) and modular meshes (cut-out meshes that replace base mesh sections entirely).</li><li><strong>Hide Mesh Functionality:</strong> Includes functionality to hide other meshes for specific armour pieces, such as a helmet hiding hair, sunglasses, or beards.</li></ul><p><br /></p><p><strong>Versatile and Robust</strong></p><p>n00dArmour adapts to a wide range of game types and styles, providing modularity and variation for your characters. With starting slots to customize initial loadouts and the ability to hide meshes, n00dArmour offers unparalleled flexibility.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Part of the n00dWorkshop Suite</strong></p><p>Fully integrated within the n00dWorkshop suite, n00dArmour ensures compatibility and seamless interaction with other n00d assets.
