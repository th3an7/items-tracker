  "longDescription": "<p>T<strong>errain Starter Pack</strong> is a combination of textured meshes, heightmaps, particle systems and a procedural terrain material for helping head start terrain development in your project.</p><p><br /></p><p>The meshes include flowers, rocks, grass and trees, each with 3 LODs. The heightmaps are randomly created maps that can be imported to the landscape tool and generate terrains without much effort. The particle systems are of simple fog, leaves flying around, a bird in orbit and simple snowfall. The procedural material renders grass and rocks as per the angle of the vertices, but take them to a bigger height, and grass slowly fades to snow. Similar effect exists on the meshes and all of them are completely controllable. Users can also easily change to their own textures as they like.</p><p><br /></p><p>In time I do plan to keep updating the pack with more meshes and may be something else too. I can very well do with some suggestions or requests in my inbox or in the comments section!</p>",
