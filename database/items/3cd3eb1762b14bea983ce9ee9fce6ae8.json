  "description": "10 adaptive music themes for the Sci-Fi game genre, in moderate tempo. All audio files are seamless loops with separated layers to create a flexible, interactive, and dynamic background music experience.",
  "longDescription": "<p>This pack offers two categories of music: Basic and Multitrack. </p><p><br /></p><ul><li>In the <strong>Basic </strong>category, themes are provided in two variations (Full and Lite), designed to crossfade between each other rather than playing simultaneously. For example, as the Lite version fades out, the Full version fades in at the same time. This is the best approach since both Full and Lite share some identical instrument parts, and those would be doubling unnecessarily if they&#39;d play at the same time in full volume. Crossfading takes care of this.</li></ul><p>  </p><ul><li>In the <strong>Multitrack </strong>category, themes are divided into separate layers (Ambient, Lead, Bass, Guitar, Beat), allowing these layers to play simultaneously. For instance, you may start with only the Ambient and Lead layers and then bring up the volume of the Bass, Beat, and Guitar layers when encountering enemies or any other chosen trigger defined in your game.</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Additionally, full versions of the loops are included for users who do not require the adaptive music feature.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cyberwave-orchestra/sets/adaptive-music-dynamic-sci-fi-background-music-loops?si&#61;aad2f8aca0f94190891433c8a5f07885&amp;utm_source&#61;clipboard&amp;utm_medium&#61;text&amp;utm_campaign&#61;social_sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">SoundCloud Preview</a></p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TQ6nrBjnfShJrryCpIHTODN8xcO1YmX5/view?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Files Included List</a></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><em>We appreciate hearing from our buyers and value your feedback!
