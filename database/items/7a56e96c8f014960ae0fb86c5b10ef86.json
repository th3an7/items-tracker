  "description": "The Stealth AI Starter Pack gives you access to dynamic, fully customisable, and easy-to-use AI systems such as patrol, sight and audio detection, chase with music, and much more.",
  "longDescription": "<p>This Stealth AI starter pack will allow you to set up multiple AI in your level at the click of a button that the player will have to stealthily manoeuvre around. These AI are easily customisable, either globally in the blueprint or individually in the level.</p><p><br /></p><p>Trailer: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/3bf0yr4w8NI\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link</a></p><p>Tutorial(s): <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1Hm-muJ2tGc\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link</a></p><p>Documentation: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ggA4Oi_0Qx_3PF9j2LljVgHUcZGyiKlsaPYUhNfkMLs/edit?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link</a></p><p><br /></p><p>All the AI use behaviour trees and blackboards and are set up so that you can easily add on to the current existing structure, or remove/change anything you don&#39;t like.</p><p>An example map is also included to test out the different AI in action. On top of this, there are 10 whistle SFX included so that the player can distract/taunt the enemies in proximity to the player, as well as chase music.</p><p><br /></p><p>When placing the AI blueprint in the level, you can decide between three main AI types by default, or easily create your own new category to choose from. The three included by default are as follows:</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Patrol AI</strong></p><p>The patrol system in this pack is all done through one blueprint. You can place it in your level, assign it to a value, and create your own patrol path. Then assign as many AI as you want to patrol this path.</p><p>Using just the one blueprint, you can create as many patrol paths as you want in your game. The AI will stick to this patrol path until they detect the player, upon this they shall chase the player and then return to their next patrol point on the path once the chase ends.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Guard AI</strong></p><p>A guard AI can be set up to guard the location they spawn in at, or walk to a set location in the level to guard there.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Search AI</strong></p><p>The search AI will randomly search a defined area to look for the player.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Sight Detection</strong></p><p>All AI are equipped with vision to be able to detect and chase the player. The sight detection settings can be modified to your desires.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Noise Detection</strong></p><p>All the AI also contain the ability to hear noises that you define. This means the player can distract the AI or be caught out by making too much noise. Upon hearing a noise, the AI will go to the area the noise came from to investigate, and then will chase the player if they are seen.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Chase</strong></p><p>If the AI has detected the player, they will start chasing until they either catch the player or lose them. Upon losing the player, the AI will continue searching for a defined time before returning to what they were doing before chasing. For example, a patrol AI will go back to it&#39;s patrol path and resume where it left off. The guard AI will return back to it&#39;s guard post, and the search AI will continue searching the area randomly.</p><p>When a chase is initiated, chase music will start and continue playing until the final AI has stopped chasing the player.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Detection Meter/Bar</strong></p><p>When the AI first sees the player, a SFX will play and a detection meter/bar will pop up above the AI&#39;s head indicating that this AI has seen the player, and if they are still currently detecting the player. Once this bar fills up, another SFX will play and the bar will change colour before then initiating a chase with chase music. If the player is already being chase, the AI will join in instead of starting a new chase.</p><p>This detection meter can be toggled on/off. Meaning the AI will give chase immediately upon seeing the player.</p>",
