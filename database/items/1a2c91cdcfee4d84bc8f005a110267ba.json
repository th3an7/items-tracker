  "description": "A dynamic split screen system that elegantly merges when players are close together.",
  "longDescription": "Preview: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vsRrB0ZggE4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/vsRrB0ZggE4</a><br /><br />Allow your players to move as a team in one large view, or split it up when they want to wander off on their own!<br /><br />The dividing line in this split screen system always draws a line right between the two players, and the thickness of the line indicates the distance they are from each other.<br /><br />Similar to the split screen systems found in the LEGO games and Fallen Frontier.<br /><br />In addition to the regular mode, there is a &#34;sticky&#34; version where the line snaps vertically and horizontally, which could be useful in racing or side-scrolling games.",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>**CAVEATS**</p><p>• Due to using an overlay, there is a visual delay of a few milliseconds, which would make this system less useful for twitchy games.</p><p>• The rendering is not optimized, so this system will increase the hardware requirements of your game.</p><p>• The system is made to work on flat ground only, but could be modified to take elevation changes into account.</p><p>* To test, make a &#34;Top Down&#34; project (so the inputs are set up for you), then open the example map. (For 4.20&#43;, you must <strong>replace SimpleMoveToLocation in TopDownController with the non-deprecated SimpleMoveToLocation</strong>. And for 4.22 move player 1 to not start on top of a pillar, if that&#39;s a problem for you.)</p><p><br /></p><p>Included:</p><p>• one blueprint library</p><p>• a capture widget</p><p>• a material and material function</p><p>• two render targets</p><p>• a full example level</p><p><br /></p><p>Features:</p><p>• two-player split screen system that merges when players are close together</p><p>• tune every aspect of the system to suit your game (line thickness, line thickness damping, merged deadzone size, snapping, etc.)</p><p><br /></p><p>Engine Compatibility: 4.13&#43;</p><p>Intended Platform: Desktop</p><p>Documentation Included: See the video preview for documentation.</p>",
