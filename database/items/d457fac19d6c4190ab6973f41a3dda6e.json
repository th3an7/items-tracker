  "description": "Create Physical Material profiles for varied footstep and impact effects",
  "longDescription": "<p>Data system and component for footstep and impact implementation in Blueprint. Add the Physmat_Interaction component to your character and create your own custom physical material profile for their class for speedy implementation of footsteps. SFX and VFX are NOT included however a few original concrete, glass and dirt SFX, as well as rudimentary VFX are included for demonstration, if you find them useful feel free to make use of them for your project.</p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features:</p><ul><li>Â Use Data Tables as profiles for different character types that require different effects</li><li>Easily add new physical materials with corresponding effects as Data Table rows</li><li>Component based so you can add it straight to your characters, just call the functions</li><li>AI Perception Noise Events included with example implementation in the Thirdperson Character</li><li>Create countless physical material profiles with customizable running and walking footstep SFX, footstep decals, footstep VFX, light and heavy impact VFX and SFX ( for weapons ) with expansion kept open</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>To get this working on your character, just add the component and call the functions &#39;Footstep&#39; or &#39;Impact&#39;. For firstperson characters with no mesh, a movement activated timeline can be used. Even simpler on a character with a thirdperson mesh as animation notify events. Both examples are provided.</p><p><br /></p><p>To add physical material profiles, open the Data Table in the main folder and add a new row, the Row Name must match the Physical Material Name. If there are any effects you don&#39;t need just leave them blank. Assign the Physical Material to world geometry via the override in the actors themselves, or directly within materials. </p><p><br /></p><p>Note if a world mesh has more than one physmat type, the collision must be set to complex or be separated into multiple meshes, otherwise the first material in the Material Slots will always be returned.</p><p><br /></p><p>Network Replicated: Yes</p><p>Supported Development Platforms:</p><p>Windows: Yes</p><p>Mac: No</p><p>Documentation:</p>",
