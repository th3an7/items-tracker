  "longDescription": "<h1>WHIRL PANELS</h1><p><br /></p><p>This plugin is demo collection, which can be used to know how to create custom panels with different layouts. At the moment it contains several custom panels:</p><p><br /></p><p>Features:</p><ul><li>Use CircularPanel for planar circular layout</li><li>Use CircularPanel3D for projective circular layout (Focal projection)</li><li>Use SpiralPanel for planar spiral layout</li><li>Use PaginatorPanel for paging layout</li><li>Use TiledImage1D for 1D paving with Brush</li></ul><p><br /></p><p><u>CircularPanel</u></p><p>This panel is very simple, it just arranges its children on the ellipse. <strong>RadiusA</strong> and <strong>RadiusB</strong> are ellipse radius params, both are expressed in half width and half height of available geometry. <strong>Angle</strong> is just angle offset for children arrangement…</p><p><br /></p><p><u>CircularPanel3D</u></p><p>This panel can be interesting because it actually build some positions in 3D space and after that use Focal projection to place them on plane. <strong>RadiusA</strong> and <strong>RadiusB</strong> are ellipse radius params, both are expressed in half width and half height of available geometry. <strong>Angle</strong> is just angle offset for children arrangement. <strong>Alpha</strong> and <strong>Betta</strong> are rotation angles in 3D space, that will be applied to ellipse before projection (for example, check spherical coords sys). <strong>FocusZ</strong> is z position of projection focus point (z axis is orthogonal to screen and pointing from screen to you). ProjectionZ is z position of screen to render projected image (z axis is orthogonal to screen and pointing from screen to you). DrawDebugEllipse is just a debug param, if it is checked debug ellipse will be drawn…</p><p><br /></p><p><u>SpiralPanel</u></p><p>This panel is very simple, it just arranges its children on the spiral. <strong>Radius</strong> is start radius from the center of spiral, expressed in half distance (width and height depending on engle). <strong>Angle</strong> is just start angle. <strong>RadiusStep</strong> is value added to radius for each next child… AngleStep is value added to angle for each next child…</p><p><br /></p><p><u>PaginatorPanel</u></p><p>This panel controls children size and is placing them like card deck. <strong>StartIndex</strong> and <strong>ItemCount</strong> controls which subset of children is displayed. <strong>ItemSize</strong> defines children size. <strong>Direction</strong> gives opportunity to place deck Vertically, Horyzontally or in any direction on 2D. <strong>TargetIndex</strong> and <strong>TargetAlpha</strong> should be used to control animated switch from one value of <strong>StartIndex</strong> to another…</p><p><br /></p><p><u>TiledImage1D</u></p><p>This widget can use one image brush and repeat it in the selected direction with auto fit to available geometry space. <strong>InverseOrder </strong>controls what item should be hidden by other - previous by next or next by previous. <strong>Direction</strong> controls direction in which tiling repeat pattern goes. Widget is working only in full stretching mode (horizontally and vertically) in the same manner as ScaleBox does…</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://discord.gg/TjxHxkwzRb\" rel=\"nofollow\">SUPPORT/FEEDBACK</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/Pentangle&#43;St.\" rel=\"nofollow\">CHECK OTHER PLUGINS BY US</a></p>",
