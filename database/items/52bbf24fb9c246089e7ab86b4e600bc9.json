  "longDescription": "<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tyPc7TQOB6bjt3iuLLfJI8w28QsG4-5EkbZ_rJ_Y5i8/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DOCUMENTATION</a></p><p>The Mobile Camera Enhanced Input system is a plug and play product that makes use of Enhanced Input’s modularity to inject mobile third person camera controls into any player character simply by adding the Mobile Camera Input Component to them. Controls include panning ( drag, analog ), rotation ( drag, analog, rotate gesture ), and zoom ( pinch gesture ), as well as touch 1 and touch 2 double tap actions which inject input into any other action of your selection. Ideal for top-down characters and third-person characters. Supports touch controls being used simultaneously with virtual joysticks.</p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features:</p><ul><li>Camera Rotation - Rotation can be orbital or not ( axis of rotation is character vs the pan offset ), set pitch limits, rate scale, or set whether to keep relative rotation which will then rotate with the character.</li><li>Camera Panning - Pan offset can be kept relative or absolute ( will rotate with character or keep world position ), limit pan radius, pan rate scale, can set a delay for automatic pan offset reset ( double tap will also reset by default )</li><li>Camera Zoom - Configure camera min &#43; max zoom distances and zoom rate scale</li><li>Rotation, panning and zoom can each be set to additive input or not ( holding in place will continue to apply input )</li><li>Manages input conflicts - Dynamically disables touch 1 events when touch 2 events are actuated. Also includes Maintain Input Value trigger which requires the input value be maintained ( with tolerance ) for a specified duration to be accepted</li><li>Touch Index Offset is a feature that dynamically adjusts the touch index mappings of actions to compensate for certain actions consuming their input such as virtual joysticks.</li><li>This product will maintain support, and will update with coming changes to Enhanced Input, so please leave a question with any issues or requests - thank you!</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Number of Blueprints: 1 Component, 1 Touch Interface, 4 preset Mapping Configs ( Joystick A/B, Touch A/B ), 1 Input Trigger, 2 Input Modifiers, 15 Input Actions, 4 character setups for demonstration</p><p>Input: Mobile / Touchscreen</p><p>Supported Development Platforms: Android, not tested on iOS however only universal touch inputs are used.</p><p>Documentation: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tyPc7TQOB6bjt3iuLLfJI8w28QsG4-5EkbZ_rJ_Y5i8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here</a></p>",
