Built on years of experience and community-driven feedback, AGR V introduces advanced systems for locomotion, inventory management, and projectile mechanics, all with a focus on multiplayer performance and scalability. This modular toolkit is ideal for developers looking to create large-scale multiplayer experiences, offering seamless integration with Unreal Engine’s existing features and simplifying the creation of immersive, responsive gameplay.</p><p><strong>Key Components:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>AGR Locomotion:</strong></li></ul><p>AGR Locomotion drives character rotation and aim offset with extreme precision, ensuring smooth, jitter-free animations, even in first-person perspectives. Designed for multiplayer environments, it leverages Unreal Engine 5&#39;s thread-safe functionality and asynchronous proxy calls, minimizing multiplayer footprint by using only replicated movement data. It supports both character and pawn classes and integrates easily with any movement component.</p><ul><li><strong>AGR Inventory:</strong></li></ul><p>The AGR Inventory system combines inventory and equipment management into a single, efficient component. It features custom serialization and replication for seamless multiplayer performance, allowing for persistent item storage and automatic inventory updates upon player reconnection. The system includes event dispatchers for UI updates and item logic, making it highly customizable and easy to integrate into any project.</p><ul><li><strong>AGR Projectiles:</strong></li></ul><p>AGR Projectiles includes a projectile launcher and projectile components, offering a robust system for spawning and managing projectiles with custom penetration and bounce logic. It supports homing, physical material interaction, and physics sub-stepping, ensuring realistic and performant projectile behavior in multiplayer settings. The system is easy to set up, highly configurable, and designed with network optimization in mind.</p><ul><li><strong>AGR Function Library:</strong></li></ul><p>An ever-growing library of utility functions designed to streamline common game development tasks. Current features include functions for camera and cursor aim calculations, component retrieval, angle calculations for hit reactions or ricochets, and velocity-based rotation determination. This library enhances development efficiency by providing ready-to-use solutions for frequent challenges.</p>",
