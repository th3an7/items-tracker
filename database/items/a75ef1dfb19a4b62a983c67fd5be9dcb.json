This is a work-around for the UE5 editor bug which causes additive settings to be removed from retargeted animations.</p><p>- Updated retargeting portion of the documentation.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong><em>UPDATE 5</em></strong> - May 12th, 2023</p><p>- For engine versions 5.1 and higher: Upgraded to the Enhanced Input system since the old input system was deprecated.</p><p>- Fixed an issue introduced in UE5.0 that could result in wrong character rotations during a ground slam.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong><em>UPDATE 4</em></strong><em> - May 24th, 2022</em></p><p><em>- Added UE5 support</em></p><p><em>- Made small adjustments to the documentation for UE5</em></p><p><br /></p><p><strong><em>UPDATE 3</em></strong><em> - July 18th, 2020 - Multiplayer is now supported! This update makes significant changes to the blueprints in order to provide network support, but gameplay functionality remains the same. Documentation has been updated to match the new blueprints. [Note: The old, simpler singleplayer blueprints are still available in engine versions 5.0 and older if you would like to use those. But be aware they haven&#39;t been supported since this multiplayer update.]</em></p><p><br /></p><p><strong><em>UPDATE 2</em></strong><em> - June 24th, 2020 - System has been modified to improve compatibility with ALS (Advanced Locomotion System) - it is now much easier to combine these two systems. Documentation has been updated to include some steps unique to merging with ALS. Some minor bugs have been fixed.</em></p><p><br /></p><p><strong><em>UPDATE 1 </em></strong><em>- February 18th, 2020 - Blueprints are now component-based to make integrating into existing characters easier. Step-by-step instructions for merging into an existing character can now be found in the FlightDocumentation folder.</em></p><p>&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;</p>",
