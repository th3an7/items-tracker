It is performant, contains several options for easy customization and use, and is driven by Gameplay Tags to control the effects and main settings.</p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features:</p><ul><li>19 Post Process effects.</li><li>Native Post Process Settings Exposed.</li><li>Effects have several settings, and can be combined.</li><li>Uses Gameplay Tags for main settings (Enable/Disable, Bound/Unbound) as well as what effects to apply, making for easy configuration in the editor, as well as controlling during gameplay.</li><li>Can be set to have no bounds (global post process), or be local limited the bounding box (local)</li><li>Does not run on tick! Uses a timer with controllable check rate, as well as provides options for manual control for maximum performance. Version 1.1 only executes the timer once per tick.</li><li>v1.1, most materials are Blendables now, so they can be used without the GonzoFX actor.</li><li>v1.1 is 5.4&#43; only</li></ul><p>Code Modules:</p><ul><li>Â Gonzo (Runtime)</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Number of Blueprints: 0</p><p>Number of C&#43;&#43; Classes: 1</p><p>Network Replicated: No (Nothing with this actor really needs to be replicated)</p><p>Supported Development Platforms: Windows.</p><p>Supported Target Build Platforms: Windows.</p><p><br /></p><p>Important/Additional Notes: This plugin has been tested exclusively on Windows, so that is currently why this is the only listed platform. I would expect there to be little to no code refactoring to allow for targeting any engine platform. If I get additional environments to test, I will try to add official support for other platforms.</p><p><br /></p><p>The same goes for Unreal Engine version 5.0. Earlier versions than 5.1 will not be officially supported, but should be trivial to re-architecture if needed for your project, if you choose to try using this with a previous version. I do plan on officially supporting all future versions of the engine.</p>",
