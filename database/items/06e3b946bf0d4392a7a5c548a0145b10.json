  "description": "A collection of networked Health components and tools for games that require more complex damage calculations.",
  "longDescription": "<p>Support Discord - https://discord.gg/RY2kuAkqbC</p><p>Full Demo - https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/lu592v17lzkwq5m8b6al4/h?rlkey&#61;lgjmnbzqflewcbsa5o2mwowmj&amp;dl&#61;0</p><p><br /></p><p>The full demo showcases all 4 bundles. You will only receive the items from the bundle you purchase.</p><p>All bundles include every module from lesser bundles</p><p>If you own or intend to buy a higher tier bundle, you don&#39;t need to buy this, As it will already be included.</p><p><br /></p><p>This Bundle includes the following modules</p><p>-SHSS - Simple Health &amp; Simple Damage Protocol</p><p>-SHSD - Hit Detection</p><p>-SHSB - Basic Health</p><p>-SHSG - General Health</p><p>-SHSA - Advanced Health &amp; Advanced Damage Protocol</p><p>-SHSL - Advanced Layered Health</p><p>-SHSC - Complex Damage Protocol</p><p>-Regen Tools</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>All health modules are implemented as actor components. They are intended to be as easy to install as possible on new or existing projects. You should not have to redesign your player to use this.</p><p>You just need to give it damage events, and the health system will report back with events when health related events occur.</p><p>All health values are maintained with data tables in all versions.</p><p>The health modules from the simple and basic health bundles are also backwards compatible with the advanced and complex damage protocols from the advanced bundles.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>-----------------------------------------</p><p>Highlighted Items Included With This Bundle</p><p>-Advanced Health</p><p>Advanced Health introduces 2 new damage protocols. Advanced damage now gives you control over penetration and distribution of damage based on: damage and resistance types, material settings, and penetration vs. pen protection.</p><p>Advanced damage is a fully fleshed out system with lots of options and settings. Complex damage expands upon this by allowing you to layer multiple damage types, and implement them as a single attack.</p><p><br /></p><p>-Advanced Layered</p><p>The Layered Module is further expanded to the general module. In addition to using Advanced &amp; Complex damage. You can now setup as many layers as you require.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>-----------------------------------------</p><p>Items Included From Simple Bundle</p><p>-Simple Health</p><p>The simple health Component is lightweight and useful for games that don&#39;t need complicated health functions. This would work well in alot of smaller games that need a quick and easy system to manage player health</p><p>In more complex games this might also work well as a system for item durability, or breakables, But without all of the heavier calculations of the more advanced Modules.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>-Hit Detection</p><p>The Hit detection Module is an easy way to manage objects that you would like have networked events on impacts from damage events</p><p>This system does not have health values. instead it has damage thresholds that can be set to determine if the attack was strong enough to merit a response</p><p>This is great for use with things like targets, breakables, or weak points on an enemy. The result of the impact would be a triggerable event that you can do your own thing with</p><p>You can have as many Detection Components as you want built into your SHSD module which.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>-----------------------------------------</p><p>Items included from General Bundle</p><p>-Basic Health</p><p>The Basic Health Module is identical to Simple Health, except that regen tools has been installed and is setup to replicate. You will now have more options to manage your players health in game.</p><p>All Health Modules from this point on, will have regen enabled on all health components.</p><p><br /></p><p>-General Health</p><p>The General Health Module Gives you 3 layers of health components to work with. Each can be addressed separately. Or in the case of standard damage calculation, Damage will start at the top, and remaining damage will be passed down to the next layer.</p><p><br /></p><p>-RegenTools</p><p>RegenTools is a Function Library full of functions that make it easy to simulate a set rate of increase or decrease in float values</p><p>These tools can also be used in more than health models. As this is a function library, it is not networked by default, However you may look at the various health modules for examples on how to set it up for networking.</p>",
