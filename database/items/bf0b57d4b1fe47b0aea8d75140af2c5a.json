They all have a really bad ass knight character that fits into a fantasy world. There is nothing cooler than having a fantasy knight in your own game and this package gives you just that.</p><p><br /></p><p>What is even better than having a fantasy knight in your game? Having several ones! If this is what you are looking for, then this package is made right just for you.</p><p><br /></p><p>With 59 skeletal meshes it is possible to choose between several combinations to create an unique fantasy knight. Swap between different types of pieces and put new materials to create an unique character for your game. It also comes with a Blueprint to setup the different skeletal meshes. This will save you a lot of time.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is perfect if you are making a game that needs swappable pieces like in MMO or RPG games. It works with any animation package that uses the UE4 Mannequin, so it is compatible with all the animations provided in the Unreal Marketplace.</p><p><br /></p><p>The characters have master materials that are flexible enough to create any look you need, from changing different colors to damage armor and cover the entire armor with blood. Also, it comes with APEX Cloth files to take the most out of the system.</p><p><br /></p><p>Yes, it comes with a fantasy sword too, we want you to use it right away!</p>",
