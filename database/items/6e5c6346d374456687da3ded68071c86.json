  "description": "Your collection of stylized materials to drag and drop into your scenes or build upon on your own!",
  "longDescription": "<p>Update 1.1: Added multiple plug and go effects, without any setup required whatsoever other than putting them into a postprocess volume. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;Zl7L0RaahTc\" rel=\"nofollow\">Preview some of those here!</a></p><p><br /></p><p>Tutorial/Documentation - As of now in short the process fortunately can simply be described as &#34;Pick a Base material that you think looks nice and create a Material instance, then adjust the parameters to your liking based on the names and descriptions given directly within the Engine&#34; - this process can be applied for both post process and material based effects</p><p><br /></p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p><br /></p><p>Create your own beautiful material instances based on the comprehensive list of stylized base materials for either directly using in your scenes or dissecting the provided shaders to create your own systems based on the materials and nodes provided through this plugin!</p><p>This asset pack includes a ton of ready to use base materials for you to quickly create your own instances with tons of customizability options.</p><p><br /></p><p>List of available system options:</p><ul><li>Material based cel shading ready to use in any scene based on a &#34;faked&#34; lighting attenuation with full control over how the shading is calculated through either a fully customizable 1-2 Band cel shader with complete control over the band position, shadow &amp; highlight color as well as the smoothness of the bands themselves.</li><li>Post process based cel shading featuring full inclusion of outlines that you can disable at will which enables the use of shadow based outlines fully adapted to the cel shading type you&#39;re currently using. In addition to this there is an actual base material that includes all the functions a post process shader would normally be missing - for example specular/rimlight highlights different for individual objects as well as full control over the base color used in the postprocess shader. If individually adapting multiple objects with different styles is not what you want there&#39;s also the option to completely forego these and use globally set specular/rimlight options calculated directly in post processing</li><li>A fully adaptable water shader including visually stunning caustics projected onto any surface occluded by the water which means this asset provides a cheap drag and drop option of having stylized water with actual stylized caustics in your level within minutes. Anything about this shader can be fully adapted through the use of material instances and any effect like the waves, sparkle, ripple &amp; more can be adapted by using your own textures instead of the ones provided by this pack</li><li>Similar to the material based cel shader there is also a material based phong shading option included</li><li>A fully compatible and drag and drop ready Kuwahara post process material to create your own game scenes in a painted look.</li><li>Some other options for already listed materials, for example a version of the water shader that does not use translucency and instead calculates the caustics based on the single-layer-water-only &#34;Scene depth without water&#34; node which makes it more compatible with some other rendering systems.</li></ul>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features: (Please include a full, comprehensive list of the features of the product)</p><ul><li> Material based cel shading &amp; outlines compatible with mobile</li><li> Post-process based cel shading &amp; outlines laying the foundation for creating your own stylized &amp; cel shaded visuals</li><li> Enabling/disabling of unwanted features through static switch parameters so unused features are fully excluded from your material instances</li><li>A fully custom stylized water shader in</li><li>Additional stylized materials like a material based phong shader and a kuwahara postprocess shader</li><li>(Almost) full compatibility between the different shaders provided</li></ul><p>Number of Unique Materials: 13 (Minus two, when not counting the Opaque/Translucent Water Shader or Lit/Unlit versions of a similar Material as Unique)</p><p>Number of Unique Material Instances: 11</p><p>Number of Unique Material Functions: 13</p><p>Number of Textures: 6</p><p>Texture Resolutions: 5x 1024x1024, 1x 2048x2048</p><p>Number of Static Meshes: 6</p><p>Supported Development Platforms:</p><p>Windows x64: Yes</p><p>Documentation: WIP/See product description</p><p>Important additional info: If you are running into issues with Lumen GI and the post process shader (e.g. there being flickering, unclear edges, etc.) make sure that your main directional lights &#34;Source Angle&#34; and &#34;Source Soft Angle&#34; are both set to 0.0. If the issue still persists or you&#39;re still not getting the clean look you were hoping for run the editor command &#34;r.Lumen.DiffuseIndirect.Allow &#61; False&#34; to completely turn of lumens indirect lighting which should eliminate 99% of any flickering with Lumen.</p>",
