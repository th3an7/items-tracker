  "technicalDetails": "This system provides: <br />3 Styles, each style has multiple sections, Ground, Mezzanine, Trim, Window, Roof. Each has its own variation. Some more than others.<br />4 Window styles are provided. Each style has variations ( up to 8 )<br />6 pattern profiles are provided. They are used interchangeably with all style. Each facade creates even more variation by using these pattern as &#39;skins&#39; to the original building facade.<br /><br />As with all of AmmoboxStudios&#39;s system as well. Performance is a high consideration as we are using this for our internal development as well.<br /><br />Here are some optimizations: <br />( remember that when it comes to optimization , less means more ) <br />1) All windows are instanced per style, per entire row. <br />2) Each Facade style is represented by a 1 ( Single ) material iD only. If entire row uses a single style this means it&#39;s only using a single &#39;set&#39; of textures. <br />3) All Window style used one set of texture. Variation is panned using Per-Instance Data. <br />4) All styles are equipped with LOD for the individual section meshes. <br />5) Pattern profile uses 2048 sets that is shared across all style.",
