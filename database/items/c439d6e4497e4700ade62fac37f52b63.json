  "description": "Configure your own destructible foliage through the included example project. A provided instruction will help you implement it quickly and easily.",
  "longDescription": "<p>This system was developed to provide every user of Blueprints, especially those new to it, with an affordable possibility of utilizing destructible vegetation. After properly following the instructions step by step you´ll be able to manage your destructible vegetation through a previously compiled <em>database</em>.</p><p>The instructions are <em>very simple</em> and <em>easy</em> to follow even without much prior knowledge about the engine. You won´t even need insight into Blueprints since you will be able to copy everything out of the provided example project.</p><p>However, for those wishing to understand the programming code, everything is explicitly <u>commented</u> and <u>explained</u>.</p><p>Here is a short <strong>demonstration</strong> video:</p><blockquote>https://goo.gl/TjU2fZ</blockquote><p>You are allowed to use <strong>everything</strong> contained in the example project commercially.</p><p><br /></p><h2>How it works and what you can do with it</h2><p>Firstly, in the Unreal Engine we have <em>the problem</em> that we can’t <u>easily</u> destroy foliage instanced static mesh components, but with a <em>few blueprints</em> like in my system here, it is possible. After you set up everything you can place a static mesh from your <em>foliage brush</em> and destroy it with the code that starts my code, which could be simply an “E” key-trigger. That will <u>replace</u> the foliage instanced static mesh component with a blueprint and in that blueprint you could <u>add code</u> like “when it is destroyed, give the player the destructed item in the inventory”.</p>",
