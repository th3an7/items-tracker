It is probably because you don&#39;t have dynamic footstep sounds and effects! Use this system to easily adapt and change your footstep sounds.</p><p><br /></p><h2>Key Features</h2><p>This system is extensive, the core features are as follows:</p><ul><li>Based on physical surfaces, switch footstep sounds and effects</li><li>Includes Wet footsteps trigger in shallow water</li><li>Defined in an actor component so you can drag it on your character</li><li>Works with auto landscape material, example included</li><li>Triggered via Animation Notify, easy to set up.</li><li>Also works on non-humanoid characters.</li><li>Light, Moderate, and Heavy steps possible. For instance, a light character should spawn a different sound on grass than a heavy one. These sound variants are not included but it is easy to switch!</li></ul><p> The most common surfaces are included in this project:</p><ul><li>Sand</li><li>Grass</li><li>Stone</li><li>Snow</li><li>Wood</li><li>Water</li><li>And a default surface layer for fallback if none is specified.</li></ul><h2>Extended Movement Component</h2><p>This system includes a basic “Extended Movement Component”. It is capable of</p><p>·        Handles player inputs via the Enhanced Input System. It uses input mapping and I have included an advanced method for handling and dynamically linking and unlinking mapping contexts.</p><p>·        Provides a central place for the replication of montages, particle effects, spawning actors, and sounds.</p><p>·        Is full of useful functions related to your character: Switch Global orientation between strafing and forward-facing character, Define Gender, get active camera component, and more</p><p>·        Manages the camera of the player. It includes: zooming, switching between shoulder cameras, and basic first-person view</p><p><br /></p><h2>About Hyper</h2><p>Hyper is empowering virtual world builders like yourself. Eric Ruts is running it and is the creator of all assets.</p><p>I would like you to focus on the creative side of your project, and I want to provide you with the building blocks to kickstart your dream. I have spent years of work on the assets I have made available and you are able to leverage that knowledge and work on your project! Please feel free to share your projects in Discord or via mail! I would love to know what awesome things you are working on.</p><p><br /></p><h3>Quality First</h3><p>The best and nothing less. Our core principles keep our assets the top of what’s available.</p><p>Where possible:</p><p>·        Complete and flexible, I include the most common use cases for most types of games in our products.</p><p>·        Data-Driven approach, so adapting is easy. We provide spreadsheets for mass edits.</p><p>·        Flawless integrations.</p><p>·        Blueprint only, so we keep it accessible for you and your complete team.</p><p>·        Extensive documentation, I try to comment on everything in the code. Besides that, the systems come with documentation after verification. I try to not only explain what happens by also why. I want you to be able to learn.</p><p>·        I aim for my assets to be production-ready.</p><p><br /></p><h3> Example Images and content</h3><p>On the product page, I use some example images of how it can look in a populated scene. That populated scene is not included. The scene in the example area is. Check out the demo for the full experience!</p><p>Nearly everything is made by myself! However, I am also using amazing Epic Games content where I can. Also, I do make use of CC0 assets where possible. Credits are in the readme files.</p>",
