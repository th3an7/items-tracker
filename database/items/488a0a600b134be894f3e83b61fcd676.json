  "longDescription": "<p>Bug reports or feature suggestion: erosa3d&#64;gmail.com</p><p><br /></p><p>LATEST UPDATES:</p><p>April 21, 2021</p><ul><li>Fixed &#34;Reduce All&#34; and &#34;Select All&#34; (from the &#34;Textures above 2K&#34; tab);</li><li>Fixed memory overloading issue;</li></ul><p>April 24, 2021</p><ul><li>The tool will now skip files with invalid characters on it (which was causing infinite loops);</li></ul><p>October 1st, 2022:</p><ul><li>Added option to disable the filtering of unused assets, when Full Scanning (to enable quicker iterations when that&#39;s not necessary);</li><li>Added feature to save last used settings;</li></ul><p>December 29th, 2022:</p><ul><li>Added option to load &#34;Last Valid Scan&#34; in tool, in case of crashes during operations;</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Every parameter and button in the utility has a &#34;Tool Tip Text&#34; explaining what they do, so in case you aren&#39;t sure about something, just point to it and a short explanation will pop-up!</p><p><br /></p><p>To open the utility, right-click on the file &#34;ProjOptimizer&#34; (Located inside &#34;Content/ProjectOptimizer/&#34;) and select &#34;Run Editor Utility Widget&#34;. You can dock it anywhere in the editor.</p><p><br /></p><p>With this Editor Utility you will be able to:</p><ul><li>Find empty folders (and an option to remove them automatically);</li><li>Find potentially duplicated files (this one will only give you the option to see the potential duplicates so you are able to fix it manually, to avoid damaging your project);</li><li>Check if the project contains redirectors (you can fix them by Right-Clicking on Content folder and selecting &#34;Fix Up Redirectors in Folder&#34;);</li><li>Find unused/unreferenced assets (and an option to move them automatically to a &#39;Trash&#39; folder, so they can be removed manually afterwards);</li><li>Find textures non-power of two (and an option to automatically round them to the nearest power of two);</li><li>Find textures with 4k resolution or higher (and an option to reduce them automatically to 2k, keeping aspect ratio);</li><li>Find Static Meshes without LODs applied (and an option to automatically apply LODs to them).</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>The custom settings in the utility allow you to specify directories to analyze, and add &#34;Skip Directories&#34;, for those parts of the project you don&#39;t want to touch.</p><p><br /></p><p>For finding unused/unreferenced assets, it&#39;s recommended to run the tool multiple times (an asset may be used by an unused/unreferenced one, so removing the unused will &#34;free&#34; other assets).</p><p><br /></p><p>IMPORTANT: Check the product images to be sure to enabled the required plugins.</p>",
