  "longDescription": "<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SwtDnT0hfV2GiSVylBNus0rURKPSe4Ta/view?usp&#61;share_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Documentation</a> | <a href=\"https://discord.gg/BSmsEWp\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></p><p><br /></p><p>The Extended Math Utilities/library is library both designed at speeding up the start of development and to offer new tools to developers and designers.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Want alternative or faster random number generators? </strong>This library comes with 4 custom PRNGs - including Xorshiro and XorShift256** (considered to be among the fasted non-encrypted PRNGs). In addition, this library includes an LCG and MT PRNG.  Example methods include (there are more than listed below!):</p><ul><li>Get Random Float (XoShiro)</li><li>Get Random Int (XorShift256**)</li><li>Get Random Int in Range (extended)</li><li>Get Random Float in Range (extended)</li><li>Get Random Bool (Probability)</li><li>And more in both C&#43;&#43; and BP!</li></ul><p><br /></p><p><strong>Do you often have to write the same math function in each new project?</strong> For example, do you have to write a function that returns a ratio or a percentage?  Or getting sick of having to write a method that checks if a value is even? With this plugin, never write that method again. It will be ready for you in each project you use this plugin with. Example methods include (there are more than listed below!):</p><ul><li>Get Ratio</li><li>Get Inverse Ratio</li><li>Get Percentage</li><li>And more in both C&#43;&#43; and BP!</li></ul><p><br /></p><p><strong>Need statistical methods? </strong>This library includes inferential statistics methods focusing on central tendency. This library was written by someone who has taught statistics for a decade. As such there are different options for standard deviation (estimated/sample vs population) and an array return for mode (to handle unimodal, bimodal, and multi/poly-modal returns). Example methods include (there are more than listed below!):</p><ul><li>Get Sum</li><li>Get Mean (Average)</li><li>Get Median (Average)</li><li>Get Mode (Average)</li><li>Get Sum of Squares</li><li>Get Standard Deviation (est)</li><li>Get Standard Deviation (population)</li><li>Get First Quartile</li><li>Get Third Quartile</li><li>Get Interquartile Range</li><li>And more in both C&#43;&#43; and BP!</li></ul><p><br /></p><p><strong>Want a unique AI that can use machine learning approaches? </strong>This library includes methods for the genetic algorithm and a fuzzifier. Example methods include (there are more than listed below!):</p><ul><li>Run Genetic Algorithm</li><li>Run Fuzzifier</li><li>And more in both C&#43;&#43;!</li></ul><p><br /></p><p><strong>Tired of how tedious swap methods are in blueprint?</strong> This library includes methods for swapping values between various variable types! Example methods include (there are more than listed below!):</p><ul><li>Swap Int</li><li>Swap Vectors</li><li>Swap Actors</li><li>And more in BP! (C&#43;&#43; has a special function that does more already!)</li></ul>",
