  "description": "Interaction PLUS is a code plugin that initialize advanced interaction system and add professional interaction components to your project.",
  "longDescription": "<blockquote><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;GgPG_mecaIg\" rel=\"nofollow\">DEMO VIDEO</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href=\"https://www.cancerium.com/projects/InteractionPLUS/demo.rar\" rel=\"nofollow\">PLAYABLE DEMO</a> <strong>(91 MB) (Win64)</strong></blockquote><p><br /></p><p>Interaction system which works for single/multi player games.</p><p>Easy to implement with drag n drop mechanics, compatible with any game that use pawn/character as well as first person and third person.</p><p><br /></p><p>Support: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Sj8rvpjuPk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord Server</a>, support&#64;cancerium.com</p><p><br /></p><p>If you want to make interactions functional, simply assign Triggered event dispatcher from any interaction component you wish (like Proximity Prompt or Click Detector) to your blueprint or C&#43;&#43; class function. In this situation when interactable is triggered, your function will be called.</p><p><br /></p><p>You can create your own styles for use in proximity prompts. All you need to do is create a widget (ProximityPromptStyle widget class), bind events (such as PromptShown, PromptHidden and OnTriggered) to animations/functions. Check documentation for more functions and event dispatchers needed for creating a proximity prompt style. After all go to proximity prompt class defaults and set style to Custom then set PromptWidget/CustomStyle to widget blueprint you created.</p><p><br /></p><p>[NEW!] Multiplayer support: There is ServerTriggered event dispatcher replicate interaction from client to server automatically and can be assigned to a desired server function easily without creating bunch of functions inside character for trying to replicate something. Simply turn ReplicationSupport on (from ProjectSettings&gt;InteractionPLUS) and add UInteractionPLUSNetworkListener to your character for built-in replication to work. If you wish to make your own replication system you can turn it off any time and it will be removed from shipping build.</p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features:</p><ul><li>Ultimately optimized: All interactable classes (except styles) made in pure C&#43;&#43; and no tick/loop is used. You can place 1000&#43; interactable around the world (tested) without a single fps drop. Static classes cause zero lag unless placed on a moving actor. (moving actors trigger collisions frequently but still not a big deal unless overused)</li><li>Proximity Prompt: Modern and best interaction system work with widgets useful for both FPS and TPS games. PC, Mobile (touch to trigger instead of keys) and Console platforms are supported. Can also be placed on dynamic objects and pawns.</li><li>Click Detector (No console support)</li><li>Styles: Library support for creating your own custom proximity prompt style. The plugin is built-in with 4&#43; example styles (like Modern, soft and classic) free to use.</li><li>Built-in Tasks: Proximity prompt is built-in with some simple jobs with no need for code. Some of mechanics are Destroy on Trigger and Add/remove viewport widget (like shop)</li><li>Support for any game that use Pawn or Character (first person as well as third person games).</li><li>No setup: You don&#39;t need to setup anything on your project. Simplicity in usage just drag and drop, select few checkboxes and everything works.</li><li>Ease of use: Add proximity prompt to your actor and bind events (like OnTriggered or OnButtonHoldDown) to any desired blueprint/C&#43;&#43; functions.</li><li>Full blueprint support.</li></ul><p>Code Modules:</p><ul><li>InteractionPLUSÂ (Runtime)</li></ul><p>Number of C&#43;&#43; Classes: 7</p><p>Network Replicated: Yes</p><p>Supported Development Platforms: Any platform supported by UE4</p><p>Documentation: <a href=\"https://www.cancerium.com/projects/InteractionPLUS/documentation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a></p>",
