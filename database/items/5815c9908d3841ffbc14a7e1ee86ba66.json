  "description": "The In-Camera VFX Production Test project is a real-world example that demonstrates the full suite of possibilities for live-action filmmaking with LED walls and Unreal Engine.",
  "longDescription": "Proper validation of in-camera VFX workflows requires final-quality real-time environments suitable for A-list movies, TV shows, and commercials. With that in mind, Epic Games is pleased to share a project with three scenes from the Unreal Engine 4.27 ICVFX production test. These worlds represent the scale and complexity of content that productions shoot with on stage, while also showcasing valuable features and concepts that empower filmmakers to fully leverage the live creative control provided by Unreal Engine. It also acts as a roadmap for Unreal Engine operators to graduate from a smaller test setup to a full-blown LED volume deployment and complete their virtual production journey.\n\nDive into the deep end and prepare to run a multi-user nDisplay system with the In-Camera VFX Production Test project. This project steps through more advanced topics such as how to fine-tune color grading on the LED walls in the moment to get that final adjustment for the director to nail the shot, and do so from the remote control web application. When the cinematographer and gaffer want a lighting change, learn how to achieve that with GPU Lightmass's ability to enable fast turnaround on whatever they ask for. The project also covers more technical topics like how to structure your virtual production project in Unreal Engine to facilitate artist collaboration, set up OpenColorIO (OCIO) for accurate color calibration, and configure nDisplay with multi GPU (mGPU) for the same NantStudios LED stage where the production test was filmed.\n\nThe project can be run on a single machine, but access to multiple machines will be necessary to experience all of its aspects.\n\n<b>Licensed for Use Only with Unreal Engine-based Products</b>\n",
