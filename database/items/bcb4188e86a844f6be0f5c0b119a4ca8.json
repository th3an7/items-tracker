All sword stands can work with all swords but might need some more placement work.</p><p>• Each model has a base mesh and 3 LOD levels(LOD1, LOD2, LOD3) and their distances&#39;ve been set manually for best visuals.</p><p>• LOD meshes in &#39;LODs&#39; folder are also imported seperately into UE4, assigned with materials and with lowest LOD level(LOD3), and are ready to be used as base meshes with lower polycount if needed.</p><p>• All models are static meshes and scaled correctly to fit Unreal Engine units.</p>",
