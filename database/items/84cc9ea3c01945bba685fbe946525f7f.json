You can create your agents in both C&#43;&#43; and blueprints very easily and re-use your behaviors in a streightforward manner.</p><p><br /></p><p>With Wise Feline you don&#39;t need to create huge and hard to follow state machines and behavior trees and instead you can give all of your actions a scoring mechanism which tells the system how important each action is at a moment in time. Because all actions are considered all the time, your AI will never be out of good options and it chooses the best action for the situation in a pretty intuitive way.</p><p><br /></p><p>Your designers no longer have to add specific transitions in state machines or conditions and nodes in behavior trees. By tweaking importance and utility of actions relative to each other in a utility AI system, they can easily change the behavior of the agents in an intuitive way and check why something behaves the way it does in the visual debugger.</p><p><br /></p><p>Because all actions are considered all the time and you can add as many actions as you want with as many scoring conditions as you want, Wise Feline is perfect for games with emergent gameplay, open world games, virtual worlds, metaverses and MMOs but it can be used not only for agents in almost all genres but you can even use it to drive things like lighting, cameras, VFX and ...</p><p><br /></p><p>State Machines and behavior trees still can be the tool of choice if you want very specific strict behavior which should be scripted exactly but if you want your agents to behave and think like humans or always choose something from their entire set of actions instead of only being able to go to specific states from a single state, Utility AI is your best bet.</p><p><br /></p><p>Utility AI works based on <a href=\"https://www.nooparmygames.com/WF-UtilityAI-Unreal/articles/actions.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">actions</a> and their importance score at each tick and this means you can change your agent&#39;s behavior based on the environment very easily. you can make your character more brave by having score <a href=\"https://www.nooparmygames.com/WF-UtilityAI-Unreal/articles/considerations.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">considerations</a> which give a higher score if friendly forces are around and ... Not that it is impossible to achieve the same thing with other approaches but it is very hard. With utility AI agents can have awesome environmental awareness and go personal and team transformations which feel very realistic from the player&#39;s viewpoint.</p><p><br /></p><p>Since actions and utilities is the way that us human think and evaluate situations with, designers can map human experiences much easier to the game agents. Why think of selector nodes and decorator nodes and state transitions, if you can think about in what situations is this action important and how much?</p><p><br /></p><p>Other packages</p><p><a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/wise-feline-influence-maps\" rel=\"nofollow\">Influence Maps</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/odds-ends-pickups-props-and-powerups-collection\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pick-Ups &amp; Power-Ups package</a></p>",
