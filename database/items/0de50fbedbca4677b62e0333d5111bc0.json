The v1 versions are my original versions and are based on UE4. If you are using UE5, I would always advise you to use the V2 version (if available). The V2 versions are significantly changed architecturally and visually and are different products, however with the same goal. All original products will stay as is and if needed I supply bug fixes for them.</em></p><p><br /></p><h1>Chaos based Choppable and Interactive Trees</h1><p>Each tree is from the supermaster class</p><p>The supermaster class is a placeholder which only hold a static mesh for performance reasons. </p><p>Feel free to change this to HISM or ISM</p><p>When the supermasterclass is touched, it spawns the CHAOS tree</p><p>The CHAOS tree can be chopped down and is from the class: Treecutting_Master</p><p>Make a child of this master to configure your own tree.</p><p><br /></p><p>You can configure the child tree. The options are as follows:</p><p>- Mass required to be chopped down before falling</p><p>- Force Multiplier (Determines how fast mass is chopped)</p><p>- Delay before fractures are destroyed after meeting threshold</p><p>- Falling Tree Sound</p><p>- Log To Spawn</p><p>- Amount of logs to spawn</p><p>- Duration Before Logs Spawning</p><p>- Does Respawn</p><p>- Respawn time</p><p>- When trunk is destroyed do not respawn</p><p>- Max Inactivity</p><p>- Delay to destroy actor if not respawning</p><p>- Damage required to destroy trunk</p><p>- Spawn item when trunk is destroyed</p><p>- Spawn this item when trunk is destroyed</p><p>- Trunk destruct sound</p><p><br /></p><p>After the tree is chopped, a log is spawned. </p><p>This log is a blueprint actor so you are able to configure it for your inventory system.</p><p>The logs you see here are configured as a Child Blueprint from the Log_Master Blueprint. You only need to configure the master.</p><p>The child actors can be used to difer the static mesh or any other variable such as amount of wood.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Configuration:</strong></p><p>Each Tree should consist of: Top, Middle, and a Trunk wherein the middle part is a destructible mesh. </p><p>Configure up to 8 destructible meshes in the middle for splitting effect.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Actor Foliage:</strong></p><p>Use actor foliage to spawn the &#34;Placeables&#34;.</p><p>Make sure to configure shadow settings to your peformance requirements.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Bonus!</strong></p><p>A Vegetation Debris and Stump. </p><p>Bot used the logic if the normal master and tricked it&#39;s logic.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h1>Quality first:</h1><p>The best and nothing less. Our core principles keep our assets the top of what’s available.</p><p>Where possible:</p><p>– Complete and flexible, we include most common use-cases in our products.</p><p>– Data-Driven approach, so adapting is easy. We provide spreadsheets for mass edits.</p><p>– Flawless integrations.</p><p>– Blueprint only, so we keep it accessible for you and your complete team.</p><p>– Extensive documentation, in code and in docs. Not only what happens by also why. We want you be able to learn.</p><p>– Production-ready.</p>",
