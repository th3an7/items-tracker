EasyMapper’s material instances are cleanly organized for easy art direction, and with a few clicks, you will be able to texture entire levels in moments, and give your models the detail they deserve.</p><p>You can toggle between World-Aligned (Triplanar) texture projection, giving you full control over the size/scale of your texture projection. Or you can use your “regular” UV mapping on your models if needed.</p><p>With the help of Nanite tessellation/displacement, you can also displace your models using height/displacement maps.</p><p>To top it all off, you can add realism to your models by blending up to 3 different materials with the help of advanced Vertex Blending, with full blend controls using the height/displacement data of the materials to ensure realistic blending.</p><p><br /></p><p>Designed and intended for Cinematics usage.</p><p><br /></p><p>Required Plugins (For Vertex Painting as shown in the Documentation tutorial):</p><p>ModelingToolsEditorMode</p><p>StaticMeshEditorModeling</p><p><br /></p><p>*Nanite is not strictly necessary for EasyMapper, but tesselation/displacement won’t work if Nanite is disabled on a given model.</p><p>*Nanite Displacement/Tessellation will not work with Pathtracing, as Pathtracing does not utilize Nanite.</p><p>* Disclaimer: Nanite Tessellation/Displacement does not currently seem to work on Mac or AMD graphics cards as of Unreal Engine 5.3. This is an engine issue, not related to EasyMapper.</p>",
