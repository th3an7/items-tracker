In 3D space this is even more important!</p><p><br /></p><p>Platformer Drop Shadow is a set of materials and Blueprint functions that will create a dynamic drop (or blob!) shadow underneath your characters whenever they&#39;re in the air to help you judge their position. The effect is very customisable, and has been designed to appear only when needed and to be as unobtrusive as possible so as to not clash with the actual lighting in your levels.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you have any questions or would like to request changes/updates, please reach out. If something doesn&#39;t seem right to you, you&#39;re likely not the only one!</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:support&#64;techarthub.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">support&#64;techarthub.com</a></p><p><strong>Discord: </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/9gg8qARMYX\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://discord.gg/9gg8qARMYX</a></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Update history:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>2.3</strong> (2024-04-24) Small fixes, 5.4 release</li><li><strong>2.2 </strong>(2023-09-16) Decoupled the Decal and Scene Capture Components from the shadow casting Actor to better support changes to roll and pitch.</li><li><strong>2.1</strong> (2023-08-20) Fixed a bug that was causing the shadow not to draw when the subject&#39;s position was in -Z</li><li><strong>2.0 </strong>(2023-02-26) More values exposed for greater control, All logic moved into its own Actor Component, Enhanced Input supported added for UE5.1&#43;</li><li><strong>1.1 </strong>(2022-03-29) Small fixes, 5.0 release</li><li><strong>1.0</strong> (2022-03-28) Initial 4.26-4.27 release</li></ul>",
