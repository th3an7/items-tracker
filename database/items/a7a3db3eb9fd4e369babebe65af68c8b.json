  "longDescription": "<p>Demo Video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;_46lVHVMTnA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;_46lVHVMTnA</a></p><p>How To Use: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;ZGxr_x22TAQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;ZGxr_x22TAQ</a></p><p><br /></p><p>This system allows you to create a 2D widget or User Interface element that shows a display of returns, with the ability to have it actively scanning around and only updating targets in the currently scanned direction at any given moment, like a mechanically steered radar, or modern type using certain search patterns.</p><p><br /></p><p>In more detail the 2D Radar System consists of an actor, and a widget. The actor can be placed in the world on its own or attached to another actor and simply acts as the sensor in the world, finding valid targets depending on a variety of options set. That data can then be set up to be forwarded to other objects, such as the included widget, upon request.</p><p>The widget is set up to show the targets on a 2d plane, with old fashioned radars in mind (and sonars as seen in many movies). This widget can be placed in the world on a widget component allowing for it to be placed in the cockpit of a vehicle or on a terminals screen, or it can be loaded into the players screen and displayed as part of the normally seen UI in screen space.</p><p>The sensor itself is capable of detecting actors with given tags around it, within specific conditions like a horizontal and vertical field of view. It also can use a scanner that sweeps from side to side in various ways, only updating what is seen in the parts the scanner is looking at right then. It has a number of options for customizing the widgets, their lifetimes, how it can spot them, and various other things.</p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features:</p><ul><li>Ability to detect actors just by giving them a tag.</li><li>Options to allow for multiple tags to be detected, with different visuals, lifetimes, and other options for each tag type to use individually.</li><li>Ability to only update the radar in a single direction that is currently be scanned by the scanner.</li><li>Various options to control the scanner, such as how fast it turns, what direction it goes in, or some other behaviors.</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Number of Blueprints: 9 (4 demo actors, 1 blueprint interface, 3 widgets, 1 radar actor)</p><p>Network Replicated: Finds and displays visuals client side, no replication needed normally.</p><p>Supported Development Platforms: Windows</p><p>Supported Target Build Platforms: Windows</p><p>Documentation: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YFr6Wfn-YKdXEz4wo7xg5sG3n4cxRc_FFfKKO9xLD9o/edit?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YFr6Wfn-YKdXEz4wo7xg5sG3n4cxRc_FFfKKO9xLD9o/edit?usp&#61;sharing</a></p>",
