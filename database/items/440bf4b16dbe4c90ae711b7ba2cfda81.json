  "description": "A C++ radar system plugin for UMG focused on convenience & customization.",
  "longDescription": "Preview: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/K-1kpFTDVMc\">youtu.be/K-1kpFTDVMc</a>\n\nThe most comprehensive radar & mini-map system we could think of.\n\nMain features: \n- Customization: nearly anything can be tweaked. Designed for high-level programming due to an easy Blueprint API. No C++ required at any point.\n- Scalability: intended for games where a 2D mini-map & radar are appropriate (supports side-scrollers). Can be easily used for levels with multiple floors, with a separate map representation for each. Custom overlaps feature integrates well with games using streaming levels.\n- Precision: every map has a world representation to properly project actors & environment onto the radar. \n- Power: all graphics is material based making the imagination the sole limitation of how the radar will look. \n- Convenience: provides many out of the box features. \n- Performance: written in C++ with performance in mind, maps serve to limit the amount of actors that need processing.\n\nIn-depth features: \n- A map box is placed in a world and can be moved, rotated & scaled in any way to fit the actual map to the world. \n- Actors with overlap events enabled & within a map box will be rendered according to a dynamic material that can be tweaked at any point. \n- Schemes are used to customize how materials are rendered in relation to actors.\n- The map can be zoomed in & out on one's digression which is not bound to any particular method like using the mouse wheel. \n- An option to add arrows pointing to actors which will by default be drawn on the edges of the radar, but that behavior can be overridden. \n- Deproject click & touch events onto the map plane which is derived from the map normal, its rotation & position. \n- A number of often used materials & material functions are provided out of the box.",

Unfortunately due to a bug in the UE4 v4.14.3,\n\nHTML5 is not yet supported (ticket number: UE-40051). We plan to test on multiple platforms in the near future.\n\nPlatforms Tested: Windows, HTML5\nExample Project: <a href=\"https://github.com/Heavy-Wizards/Heavy-Wizards-Radar/raw/master/samples/TPSampleProject.7z\">github.com/Heavy-Wizards/Heavy-Wizards-Radar/raw/master/samples/TPSampleProject.7z</a>",
