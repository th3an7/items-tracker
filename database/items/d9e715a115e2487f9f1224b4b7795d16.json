The soundscapes were designed using multiple layers of high-quality recordings, with various effects and post-processing to give the depth and realism needed for any sound system. You can use these soundscapes as a subtle background over which you can place music and SFX of your choice, or on their own. Cyberwave Orchestra is always open to suggestions, especially regarding future updates of this pack.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UppwT40D8caPyOyAVabAHGA3GSrgxo71/view?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Files List</a></li><li><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cyberwave-orchestra/sets/medieval-fantasy-rpg-game-soundscapes-and-ambience?utm_source&#61;clipboard&amp;utm_medium&#61;text&amp;utm_campaign&#61;social_sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hear It On SoundCloud</a></li><li>Save by getting it as a part of our big <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/1ddec00060e247f3a78521d36e8d1119\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Fantasy Bundle #1</strong></a></li></ul><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><ul><li><em>We appreciate hearing from our buyers and value your feedback!
