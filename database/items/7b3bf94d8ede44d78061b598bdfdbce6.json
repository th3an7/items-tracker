  "longDescription": "<p>Please watch this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;1b7irIGn3CE\" rel=\"nofollow\">DEMO VIDEO</a> to listen all the weapons included in this pack.</p><p><br /></p><p>Sci-Fi Punchy Gunshots contains 96 gunshot sound effects specially created for science fiction weapons.  The pack contains also a basic setup for automatic fire and a sound concurrency rule, so the sounds will not excessively overlap (very useful especially for very high fire rate or for the sounds with a long tail). Because of this, there is no need for loops and the automatic fire uses only single shots. The sound effects can be very useful for open world games but also for games where actions takes place indoor. The pack comes with a modified First Person Blueprint, where I implemented automatic fire and a system to change the weapon sound during the gameplay (pressing the keys &#34;1&#34; and &#34;2&#34; ,the player can move forward and backward through the list of gunshot sci-fi sound effects)</p>",

Increase or decrease that number to get different fire rates. This pack contains only gunshot sound effects (no reloading, cocking, etc. )</p><p><br /></p><p>If you like this pack, feel free to write a review and rate it. This will keep me motivated to create better and better assets. Thank you!</p><p><br /></p>",
