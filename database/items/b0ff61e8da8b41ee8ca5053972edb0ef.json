  "longDescription": "<p><strong>Voice Pack Info: </strong>Male character voice-over for FPS type games, featuring Greg Dunn, professional voice talent.</p><p><br /></p><p>You can preview the asset pack <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/gregory-dunn-257274948/pro-soldier-character-voice-pack-sample\" rel=\"nofollow\">here:</a></p><p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/gregory-dunn-257274948/pro-soldier-character-voice-pack-sample\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://soundcloud.com/gregory-dunn-257274948/pro-soldier-character-voice-pack-sample</a></p><p><br /></p><p>This dialogue pack includes over 1100 recordings of different words and phrases for a single character. A typical use would be a Soldier or assassin in a first or third-person combat game.</p><p><br /></p><p>There are four folders, each containing the same phrases--The difference is the intensity of their volume and attitude. Please see below for further explanation, or check out the preview video for samples. You&#39;ll also find an &#34;Extras&#34; folder containing added &#34;bonus&#34; content requested by users. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Quiet-</strong> My favorite version. These are similar to the “Whisper” pack, but with more gravitas and authority.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Shout-</strong> I would say these are best used in crazy combat situations, as the yelling can be pretty loud.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Standard-</strong> These are great for most situations. Not yelling, but not whispering either.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Whisper-</strong> These recordings are a little quieter than the rest. Good for stealthy moments. This one has a few extra sounds like Sighs and Ooohs.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Extras- </strong>Additional content that I have added in, as requested by users of this asset pack.</p>",
