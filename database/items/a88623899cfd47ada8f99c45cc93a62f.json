  "description": "HQ medieval weapon attacks pack. Multiple variations are included for a pro sound that never gets boring or repetitive! Sword, Battle Axe, Hammer, Spear, Flail, Bow & Arrow, Combo attacks, and flying projectiles! Now updated with 74 vocalized battle SFX!",
  "longDescription": "<p><strong>&#39;Sounds Of War 1&#39; </strong>is the first in a series of professionally designed combat sound packs. Every SFX has multiple variations so that you&#39;re able to trigger them randomly for the chosen attack. This is a must-have option for avoiding the infamous &#39;machine gun effect&#39; when the same attack is used repeatedly. We also included missed attacks and shield defense SFX.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>NOTE: The swing of the weapon (whoosh) and the impact of the weapon are not separated in this pack. They are connected in order to provide a quick solution for games that do not have missed target dynamics.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Save Money And Get Our <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/3a95ceabe04f487c977ad8468932b158\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sounds Of War Bundle</a>.</h2><p>Save And Get It As A Part Of Our <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/aa22978104f24b949ca5180170d26aa9\" rel=\"nofollow\">Medieval Melee Bundle</a></p><p><br /></p><ul><li>Use your imagination to combine the sounds for more advanced combos! <u>Example:</u> <em>Bow Release &#43; Flying Loop (loops as long as needed to reach the target) &#43; Projectile Cut</em></li><li>The majority of our vocalized SFX can be used for the same character animations as their non-vocalized counterparts, without any extra adjustments.
