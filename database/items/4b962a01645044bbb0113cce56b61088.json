This is a library geared towards multiplayer games, space, dystopias, utopias, fantasy, magical places, serene game moments, RPG, MMO, and sci-fi games all alike and showcases sounds like automated shipyard, electron flow, data mining, engines, mothership hums, conversions, moons of Venus, deserted area, bio engineering lab, desolate space, holy house, a variety of pulses, tech-based loops, winds, &amp; more.</p><p>Each loop is game ready, seamlessly loopable and around 1 minute in length. Each main ambiance includes 1-2 alt mix versions &#43; you get a variety of layers to accent your scene and games ambiance. Having both full ambiances, alt mixes and layers allows you to truly orchestrate your game’s background sound how you want it. If the full loop has too much going on, then try using the minimal version without the sound you don’t like or by stacking a layer loop to boost the dynamic of the atmosphere.</p>",
