PRO AAA-QUALITY MUSIC that instantly elevates the experience of your game.</p><p>2. ROYALTY-FREE MUSIC use the music without having to pay royalties.</p><p>3. FREE FUTURED UPDATES new added tracks will be free of charge.</p><p>4. FULL ORCHESTRA &amp; CHOIR to get that Epic, Cinematic feeling while playing.</p><p>5. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION is my number one priority.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Sounds like</strong></p><p>Dark Souls</p><p>Elder Scrolls</p><p>World of Warcraft</p><p>The Witcher</p><p>God of War</p><p><br /></p><p>These songs are a mix of epic, intense, energetic, triumphant music, making it perfect for combat, battles, boss battles, high-energy cut scenes, and more.</p><p><br /></p><p>My music is Youtube-Safe and can be freely used without any concerns of copyright strikes, flags, or demonetization. This is essential when players showcase your game in videos or streams for YouTube, and other similar platforms.</p><p><br /></p><p>You will not get a copyright claim and you are allowed to use the soundtracks wherever you want and as many times as you need Royalty-Free! Use the music over and over, in any of your projects or productions, without any additional fees.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Tracklist - 71 audio files </strong><em>(.wav 44.1 kHz, 16-bits)</em></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>[Main Tracks]</strong></p><p>Arm Yourselves [1:09]</p><p>Cave Troll [1:22]</p><p>Drums In The Deep [1:36]</p><p>Gather The Army [2:00]</p><p>Into The Dark [1:24]</p><p>No Return [2:15]</p><p>Regroup [2:07]</p><p>The Battle Begins [2:24]</p><p>To The Death [2:41]</p><p>Unknown Enemy [2:30]</p><p>Warhorn [2:49]</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Instructions</strong></p><p>Since I don’t know how much intensity and sound effects that you will use in each particular scene I have made “Lite” and “Full” versions. The Lite versions have minimal melodies and are more background-music-like, the Full versions are with all the intended instruments. A bonus is that you can use this to extend the track and get more variations by using the &#34;lite&#34; version first, then transition into the &#34;full&#34; version and then back to the lite version.</p><p><br /></p><p>The loops are arranged after length and can be used as they are, put in a row, or put together in a lot of different combinations using the software of your choice. There is free software that can be used for this as well.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>I’m an independent music composer that loves to write music for the orchestra. I want my music to sound high quality and epic, like “Hollywood”-music, huge, dramatic and well-produced at an affordable price.</p><p><br /></p><p>I would appreciate some constructive criticism and suggestions. It is you as a game developer or video editor that (hopefully) will be my customer and I want my music to serve your project as well as possible. </p><p><br /></p><p>Customer satisfaction is my highest priority so if you have any questions don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m also very interested to hear about the game or project that you used my music in, and I would love to listen, play and share it on my social media if i may? In other words I’d like to be a part of your project.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you so much for supporting my music!</p>",
