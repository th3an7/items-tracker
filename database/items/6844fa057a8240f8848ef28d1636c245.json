  "longDescription": "<p>The next instalment in our line of code plugins, the Character Role System was made for designers, by designers and makes a crucial part of many multiplayer games very easy. You can create whatever Roles you want your players to experience, just by defining their Win and Lose conditions.</p><p><br /></p><p>You have Editor and Runtime control over the settings for each Role, and the system will take care of the rest. Automatic registration and assignment is built in, as well as checking if any players have won/lost this plugin is incredibly powerful for both designers and programmers.  We have a plugin roadmap, and are going to be making a LTS version of this plugin for our initial engine version, 5.2, so you don&#39;t have to worry about updating your project version to keep up. </p>",
