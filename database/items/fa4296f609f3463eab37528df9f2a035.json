  "longDescription": "<p> These are a variety of one-handed construction-style mallets created for use in RPG/Survival games when upgrades or progressive versions of items are needed. These particular mallets are one-handed, generally meant as tools, but with some re-sizing these could be taken for larger hammers. The “level” of the mallets progress from wood, to stone, to metal, to crystal, which are further broken down into four levels apiece, for a total of sixteen levels.</p><p><br /></p><p>Each instance comes with additional tint and emissive controls tied to masks to create alternate colours and/or glow effects, lending to the possibility of creating a much larger item progression level. Additionally, a template has been set up to include custom glow patterns. Using this template, adding magical symbols, logos, or effects is simple! Instructions included as an image within the main project folder, as well as in preview images. Change any item to any hue, add custom glowing patterns, and make a small library of items for your project!</p>",
