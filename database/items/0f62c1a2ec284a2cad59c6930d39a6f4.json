  "longDescription": "Preview: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/F-UY2_7rPt8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/F-UY2_7rPt8</a><br /><br />Almost every aspect of this shader is a parameter. The snow/moss can be changed to any other material you want. Mud, dirt, water, ice, WHATEVER. The same can be said for the bricks and stone materials. As long as you have a height map or something similar (Strong AO Bake) the snow (or whatever) will build up through the cracks on the upward facing polys. The height maps can also be inverted for masking to have the coating be on top of the texture instead. The axis mask can also be disabled to create an all over coating of the material. The math for Roughness, Metalness, AO, contrast of the snow, and everything else is editable as parameters for use as instances. Incorporates Tessellation to literally “build up snow levels” while improving the realism of the other materials as well. This can also be turned off inside the material editor. Accepts Roughness, Metalness, and Ambient Occlusion as one texture compiled into the RGB channels. A color mask can be imported for the two base materials to increase the flexibility of the shader. This shader can use the maximum 16 texture sheets UE4 allows in one material and is completely scalable.",
