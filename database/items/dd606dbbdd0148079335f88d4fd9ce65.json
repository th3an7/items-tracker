  "description": "Customize a dark fantasy boss battle that is entirely modular and consists of 88 separate files under many different functional structures. With this audio tool, the orchestra is under your control!",
  "longDescription": "<p>Please watch our <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9kgoTXRoky4\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Quick Demonstration Video!</strong></a></p><p>For audio preview please click <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Yu8yaWKwtt4\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong><u>HERE.</u></strong></a></p><p><br /></p><p>We have imagined a boss battle concept in many ways. This package, which we believe will be a powerful audio tool for game developers, contains 3 different adaptive battle models:</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Omnidirectional: </strong>This is a model that has a specific beginning and can adapt to 8 different boss battle states throughout the sequence, ultimately concluding with an outro. Increasing the diversity and options, many percussive loops are also included in this model.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Dual Phase: </strong>The Dual Phase model consists of two different phases and is designed for game developers who want to narrate boss battle processes in phases. It can go through stages such as introduction, development, and conclusion, and can transition between these stages as desired. The model includes variation files that are a calm version of the main loop, as well as percussive loops.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Variable Intensity: </strong>Sometimes, different music may be required depending on the level of intensity in the battle. This is where the Variable Intensity option becomes meaningful. This model consists of three different intensity loops - Low, Moderate, and High - and is designed to adapt like the other two models.</p><p><br /></p><p>We have added each loop to the package in a way that they can be used together regardless of the model differences. The tempo and key information are the same.</p><p><br /></p><p>We have also composed some stinger and cue music for specific points as we thought they might be needed.</p><p><br /></p><p>Additionally, we have included some voice-over samples for the boss in the first boss battle of the Spine&#39;s End Undercity dungeon, called &#34;A Huge Gargoyle&#34;, to make it more meaningful.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Full or Full_Loop versions of this modular and adaptive system are also included in the package for developers who may want to use them.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Dungeon name: </strong>Spine&#39;s End Undercity</p><p><strong>Boss type:</strong> Gargoyle, giant, necrotic</p><p><strong>Boss&#39; name: </strong>A Huge Gargoyle (AHG)</p><p><strong>Battle models: </strong>3</p><p><strong>Adaptive loops: </strong>41 files</p><p><strong>Full-length music: </strong>10 files</p><p><strong>Variations: </strong>Yes</p><p><strong>Stingers &amp; Cues: </strong>7 files</p><p><strong>Percussive loops: </strong>14 files</p><p><strong>Character voices: </strong>30 files</p><p><strong>Total files: </strong>88 files</p><p><strong>Total unique music: </strong>46 files</p><p><strong>Total size: </strong>433 MB</p><p><strong>Total length: </strong>28:39</p><p><strong>Mastered: </strong>Yes</p><p><strong>Loudness method: </strong>Dynamic</p><p><strong>Looping: </strong>Yes</p><p><strong>Sample rate: </strong>44100</p><p><strong>File type: </strong>24-bit WAV</p>",
