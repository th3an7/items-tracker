  "longDescription": "Preview: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/refills-by-detunized/humbuzz\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://soundcloud.com/refills-by-detunized/humbuzz</a><br /><br />The material for this library was sourced from the electromagnetic fields that are emitted by fridges, microwaves, boilers, cell phones, TVs and computer components. Like all modern electronics these devices produce a complex mixture of noises that cover wide frequency ranges.<br />Surprisingly often one can also discover elements with traces of tonality. Additionally many start-up and boot noises are included.<br />These sounds are easy to use for event-driven foleys or UI elements.",
