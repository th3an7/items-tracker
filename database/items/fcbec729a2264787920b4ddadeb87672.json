  "longDescription": "<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;-Knrxyc9KBs&amp;t&#61;3s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightning Quick Start Video</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;v43G2SvXzO8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Changing the Character Video</a></p><p><br /></p><p>Just drag and drop the Lightning blueprint into your scene and you will get rain and high quality lightnings into your project. The pack also comes with lightnings specific sounds (rain, thunders). The Lightning will always face the camera and it will always spawn in front of the player but it will also be spawned in different positions and angles. Every time a lightning is spawn, it is randomly chosen from a list of lightnings. The list can be adjusted however you want (you can add more lightnings (there are 25 lightning textures in this pack), you can delete lightnings or even add your own lightning texture). You will be able to adjust directly from the blueprint, parameters like: lightning color, emissive power, the time between lightning strikes etc. </p><p><br /></p><p>The system will also work with your own character so if you want to use your own character, all you have to do is to copy-paste 2 components from my character into yours. One of the component is the rain VFX (Niagara System) and the second component is the rain sound loop. Please check the second video of this pack to see exactly how to use a different character.</p><p><br /></p><p>The lightning material updates at runtime, so if you want, you can change parameters like color, emissive power, etc., during gameplay.</p><p><br /></p><p>The lightning blueprint works in combination with the a Post Process Volume. So in order to use it, you need to add a Post Process Volume into your level and add it also into the lightning blueprint exactly as you see in this video.</p><p><br /></p><p>It is a system that works very well for large open world maps/projects but can be used also for small maps.</p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features: (Please include a full, comprehensive list of the features of the product)</p><ul><li> highly customizable (parameters like color, emissive, duration between lightnings, can be adjusted at runtime)</li><li> the system comes with rain Niagara System and specific sounds (lightnings, thunders, rain)</li><li>Because of the smart design, the lightning will always spawn in front of the camera (but at different and random locations and angles)</li><li>it will work with any type of character (first person, third person, etc. - watch the second video to see how to change the character)</li><li>high quality, 4k lightning textures</li></ul><p>Number of Blueprints: 1</p><p>Input: No input required</p><p>Network Replicated: No</p><p>Supported Development Platforms:</p><p>Windows: Yes</p><p>Mac: Not tested</p><p>Documentation: Please watch the 2 videos from the beginning of Description. If you already have a post process volume with custom settings in your scene, pay attention to my blueprint because when the lightning strikes, I replace all your custom settings with mine. So the solution to keep your custom settings is very simple. Before lightning strikes, you will have to save all your custom post process settings in a variable and after the lightning strikes, you will have to load all the post process settings from the saved variable.</p><p>Important/Additional Notes: If you like this pack, feel free to write a review and rate it. This will keep me motivated to create better and better assets. Thank you!</p>",
