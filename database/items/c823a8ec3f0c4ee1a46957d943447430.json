  "longDescription": "Video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNcIXegJ7Go\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNcIXegJ7Go</>\n\nFor some video game genres, when launching a projectile (a hand grenade, for instance) it is useful and necessary to show the player the range of said projectile and the trajectory it will travel. \n\nBy using a set of particle beams and a decal at the end of this set, this system helps the player choose the best strategy for launching a projectile towards a desired target.\n\nThis system also includes a simple way of creating more types of projectiles (classes) with minimum effort from the designer. These classes can then be a part of a projectile inventory system that keeps track of all the possible projectiles that can be launched and also lets the player know which kind of projectile will be shot. This project can also serve as a great learning tool because it covers a lot of Blueprint topics (check the list of features) and physics concepts explained in detail.",
