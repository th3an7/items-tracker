  "longDescription": "<p>Make the creepy parts of your game even more nightmarish with this pack of 10 dark ambient tracks. Clocking at 8:00 minutes each, these pieces evolve slowly to create a sense of atmosphere and place, but also present enough variety to keep things tense and interesting. If you want players to keep the lights on when they go to bed, this is the pack for you.</p><p>Themes range from heavy industrial machinery sections, deep oppressive drones with dissonant instrumentation&#39;s, and apocalyptic choral chants. These tracks are a perfect fit for genres like horror, post-apocalyptic, fantasy (especially dungeons), sci-fi, etc.</p><p>All tracks come in high quality waveform, and both start and end at volume 0 to avoid any clips or artifacts.</p><p>You can listen to some samples from the tracks <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/morefoes/sets/dark-ambient-soundscapes-vol-1-samples\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></p>",
