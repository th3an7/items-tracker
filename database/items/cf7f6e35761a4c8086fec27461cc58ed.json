  "description": "Easy and fast way of connecting components together without any \"glue\" logic in the parent Actor",
  "longDescription": "<p>Component Picker Tool allows for creating new properties called &#34;Component Picker&#34;.</p><p>Those properties are expected to be used in components as public fields, then when that component is added to an Actor the &#34;Component Picker&#34; property will allow to reference any component from this Actor&#39;s hierarchy.</p><p><br /></p><p>This plugin&#39;s purpose is to reduce the unnecessary boiler plate code that often creeps in to unreal projects to handle the communication between components.</p><p><br /></p><p>How it works:</p><p>Component Picker holds a referenced component&#39;s name.</p><p>Whenever this name changes it will automatically get updated, doesn&#39;t matter if blueprint is in memory or not, it will be marked as dirty for you to save.</p><p>At runtime the &#34;GetComponent&#34; function evaluates target component and caches it, so there is no need to cache it&#39;s output yourself.</p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features: </p><ul><li> Provides code and blueprints with a new property called &#34;Component Picker&#34;</li><li> &#34;Component Picker&#34; will throw compilation errors when left empty in Actor.
