  "description": "Use splines to create non-standard shaped blocking volumes, invisible walls and triggers.",
  "longDescription": "<p><strong>Spline Based Blocking and Trigger Volume</strong> (SBBTV) is a versatile system designed to simplify the task of zoning out your scenes and levels. Unreal&#39;s standard blocking volumes are limited to trapezoidal meshes and the trigger system is similarly limited to capsules, spheres and boxes. With SBBTV you can build zones in any shape and size using the engines spline system. Not only can this save you time, but it is also significantly less tedious and finicky than the standard methods mentioned above. It also gives you more precise control over just where the player can and cannot go, and where they have to be to trigger events in your game. Additionally, using splines means that this is a non-destructive workflow that can easily be altered at any point in development!</p><p><br /></p><p>Check out the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;evxr8Sf-zoM\" rel=\"nofollow\">product overview video</a></p><p>Videos covering updates: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;iAr_Sj3zNOI\" rel=\"nofollow\">Update 1</a> | <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;21-wy4zjC-k\" rel=\"nofollow\">Update 2</a></p><p>Here&#39;s a brief <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;mE2qhUc5B20\" rel=\"nofollow\">performance demonstration video</a> comparing the performance of Unreal Engine&#39;s blocking volumes with two implementations of SBBTV.
