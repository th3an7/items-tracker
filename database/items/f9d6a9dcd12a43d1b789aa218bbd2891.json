  "longDescription": "<p><strong>High-Performance Nanite-Optimized Tree Models</strong></p><p>Enhance your Unreal Engine environments with our meticulously crafted tree models, specifically designed for seamless integration with Nanite, Unreal Engine’s cutting-edge rendering solution. These trees are engineered for both visual fidelity and performance, featuring dense geometry in the lower sections for close-up realism and reduced triangle density in the upper sections to optimize performance during gameplay.</p><p>Key features include:</p><ul><li><strong>Opaque Materials for Peak Performance</strong>: We’ve exclusively used opaque materials to maintain optimal performance with Nanite, avoiding the pitfalls of masked materials.</li><li><strong>Strategic Geometry Design</strong>: The lower half of each tree boasts high-density geometry, delivering a highly detailed mesh where it counts. The upper sections, designed to be viewed from a distance, have lower triangle density, reducing performance impact from wind animations and lowering memory usage.</li><li><strong>Realistic Bark Texture</strong>: Using advanced mesh displacement techniques, the models are deformed to perfectly align with the texture of the bark, creating a highly realistic visual experience.</li><li><strong>Advanced Foliage Master Material</strong>: Our custom foliage master material offers a range of features, including wind dynamics, subsurface scattering, and customizable color masks for subsurface effects. This master material will continue to be updated, ensuring compatibility with future foliage assets.</li></ul><p>Whether you&#39;re crafting a dense forest or a lone, majestic tree, these models provide the perfect balance between detail and performance. Ideal for any project that demands high-quality assets without sacrificing efficiency.</p><p><br /></p><p>*As a bonus for purchasing my first published asset pack, you will also receive the Nanite grass clusters and the Nanite rocks that can be seen in the images. Both follow best practices for geometry meant to be used with Nanite, and both use opaque materials as well. The rocks include a world aligned material in order to be blended easily if you choose to place many of them in close proximity.</p><p><br /></p><p>Textures used for the trees came from PolyHaven and PBRPX. Scene in the photos is for example only and is not included in the asset pack.</p>",
