This gives you the ultimate freedom in any creative situation and has been designed with ease of use in mind. The pack consists of individually recorded and edited files alongside stereo loops to allow for the greatest flexibility within your projects. Each of our 270 individually edited Mono sound files have been meticulously crafted so that they can be used without any further editing, cutting down on production time. The stereo loops can sound very natural dropped directly into your project and can be further manipulated to suit your requirements. We believe that delivering our audio in this format creates the most flexible product of its kind, thus providing the best value.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Video Preview - </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;dsUJ-utc3Nk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;dsUJ-utc3Nk</a></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Preview - </strong><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-785478514/s23-ultimate-footsteps-bundle-preview\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://soundcloud.com/user-785478514/s23-ultimate-footsteps-bundle-preview</a></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Metadata Sheet</strong> - <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id&#61;1l1wVQ7ALgFoUk7ckmPxKqsCXQpLPXBmC\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://drive.google.com/open?id&#61;1l1wVQ7ALgFoUk7ckmPxKqsCXQpLPXBmC</a></p><p><br /></p><p>*Please</p><p>note that our preview is showcasing our entire “Ultimate Footsteps Collection”</p><p>releasing in the near future.
