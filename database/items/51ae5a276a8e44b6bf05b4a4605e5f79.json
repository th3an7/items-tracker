  "longDescription": "<p>Watch this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;oal-wD8Mulo\" rel=\"nofollow\">DEMO</a> to hear the sound effects.</p><p>Are you tired of your guns which sound like toys?  If the answer is YES, your search is over, because this pack will offer your guns, the necessary boost to take your game/project to the next level.</p><p>Punchy Gunshots contains more than 250 gunshot sound effects. There are 52 different guns but every bullet sound comes with 3-8 variations (in most of the cases there are 5 variations). As you can see in the video, every time the weapon fires, a different sound is played (which is randomly chosen) so this way the player has a very realistic experience. I have also setup an automatic fire and a sound concurrency rule, so the sounds will not excessively overlap (very useful especially for very high fire rate or for the sounds with a long tail). Because of this, there is no need for loops and the automatic fire uses only single shots. Here you can find realistic gunshots for pistol, sniper rifle, submachinegun, machinegun, shotgun, heavy artilleries, silenced shots etc. I tried o offer as much variety as possible, so there are gunshots with long tail, specific to exterior and there are also gunshots with small tail specific to closed spaces. From this point of view, the sound effects can be very useful for open world games but also for games where actions takes place indoor. The packs comes with a modified Firs Person Blueprint where I implemented automatic fire and a system to change the weapon sound during the gameplay (pressing the keys &#34;1&#34; and &#34;2&#34; the player can move forward and backward through the list of gunshot sound effects)</p>",
