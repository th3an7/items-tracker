  "longDescription": "<h1>NPC Speech Bubbles</h1><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;Pm4ye1LJJqg\" rel=\"nofollow\">DEMO AND CONFIG VIDEO</a></p><p><br /></p><p>A fully data driven approach to dynamic speech bubbles for NPCs.</p><p>Using a couple of Enumerators and a Data Table, you can easily have speech bubbles configured for your NPCs.</p><p><br /></p><p>Setup events for your NPCs... perhaps they are idling, or in combat, maybe they&#39;re investigating... each one can have it&#39;s own group of dialogue speech bubbles to choose from.</p><p><br /></p><p>All you need on an NPC actor is a widget component and the actor component that comes with this package. Then you are ready to go. Simply configure the data table with all of your NPC dialogue options, and the NPCs will randomly pull through the dialogue from that data table based on events, or repeated dialogue.</p><p><br /></p><p>You can have, for example, Town Guards that can chat while they are idle... then have an event where the player is seen, heard or interacted with and have their dialogue changed to new ones... all based on data table items.</p><p><br /></p><p>The speech bubbles auto scale based on the content of the dialogue.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is fully scalable and configurable. From the widget itself (a simple border and inner box PNG), to text colours, to the dialogue itself.</p><p><br /></p><p>Bring your environment to life with NPC Speech Bubbles.</p>",
