  "longDescription": "<p>The goal when creating this pack was to go beyond what explosion packs usually offer. We have included some great additions to the standard explosion sounds.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cyberwave-orchestra/sets/bombs-explosions?utm_source&#61;clipboard&amp;utm_medium&#61;text&amp;utm_campaign&#61;social_sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hear the sounds on SoundCloud</a></p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rklWMo38PHy0oTkx18T7z1HYr1s-cYhz/view?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Files List</a></p><p><br /></p><ul><li><strong>Realistic Explosions</strong></li></ul><p>These come in multiple flavors and offer the flexibility to choose the type of debris that matches your idea. Some of the explosions are also designed to have a bit of ricochet sound in them which is desired for certain scenarios.</p><ul><li><strong>Unrealistic Explosions</strong></li></ul><p>Made for projects that do not require realism, just some unique explosion sounds. Great for sci-fi and puzzle games for example. We also included a few retro 8bit explosion designs into this category.</p><ul><li><strong>Basic Explosions</strong></li></ul><p>Not quite realistic, but not unrealistic too! Generic all-around explosions for a variety of projects. Where there are multiple variations of an explosion like for &#39;Basic (variation 1 to 4)&#39; it means it can be adjusted to randomly select from the 4 variations in order to provide a better experience for the gamers, especially if the sound is used a lot.</p><ul><li><strong>Additional Material</strong></li></ul><p>Here is where the cool stuff can be found. These ideas go hand in hand with explosions and can spice up your game.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><ul><li><em>We appreciate hearing from our buyers and value your feedback!
