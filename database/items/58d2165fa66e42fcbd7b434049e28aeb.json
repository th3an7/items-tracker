Follow along and learn different techniques to get the best results from the Composure plugin.</p><p>We’ll explore how to place a CG actor into real footage (provided for the course). You’ll learn various ways to approach different challenges you could face when trying to recreate your own composites after taking the course. By the end, you will understand real-time compositing in Unreal Engine at a beginner level. We’ll cover concepts and practices for compositing images that are rendered in real time. We’ll also look at practical ways to achieve the visual fidelity in Unreal Engine that one would expect from Nuke, Flame, or similar DCC. Examples include integrating CG into live action and live-action keyed footage into CG for perspective and 360° cameras.</p>",
