Save the merged object to a folder of your choice preferably a new folder of your naming (i.e. Merged_Swords). Open the merged object from the content browser Enable Nanite and apply. Choose any material instance option you like from the materials folder for each of the pieces. If these steps were followed exactly there will be 4 material slots on the merged sword beginning with Blade, Cross Guard, Grip, and then Pommel.
