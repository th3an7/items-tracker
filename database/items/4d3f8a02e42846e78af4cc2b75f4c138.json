No work is required on your end to get this working other than setting some values in the defaults panel of the component and assigning the skeletal mesh to track on begin play. It supports both first person and third person characters, along with physical materials.</p><p><br /></p><p>This will work with any animation out of the box, you don&#39;t need to go through and setup anim notifies on every animation file you have. Simply add the component to your character, set the values you want, add your effects to a list, and it will do the rest for you.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>If the plugin works well for you then please be sure to leave a review letting us know what you liked about it.</strong></p>",
