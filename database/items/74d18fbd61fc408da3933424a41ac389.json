A somewhat bare bones product that has highly customizable GameTypes and Objectives that focus on specific styles of gameplay. This is fully Multiplayer ready and supported by a basic FPS Framework that demonstrates how you can utilize this package in your own games! </p><p><br /></p><p>This package contains 4 classic GameTypes you can find in many Shooter games across the years as well as current generation games. </p><p><br /></p><p>The package will consist of the following: </p><p>• DeathMatch - Completed </p><p>• TeamDeathMatch - Completed</p><p>• CaptureTheFlag - Completed</p><p>• Domination - Completed</p><p>• HeadQuarters - Not Completed (Development has ceased due to lack of support for sellers on the Marketplace by Epic)</p><p>• SearchAndDestroy - Not Completed (Development has ceased due to lack of support for sellers on the Marketplace by Epic)</p><p>• Sabotage - Not Completed (Development has ceased due to lack of support for sellers on the Marketplace by Epic)</p><p><br /></p><p>This package has a few unique features. The GameTypes are implemented as Blueprint Scene Components, this means that 1, 2 or all the GameTypes can be attached to a single GameMode class and can be switched through with the call of a single Node! With that said this also means an additional interesting feature, not only can this package be built upon as a Standalone Project, but it can also be merged with existing content! </p><p><br /></p><p>Developers can easily create their own GameTypes as well, following the Template design of the existing GameTypes that come with the package it will be easy to see how they are put together.</p>",
