  "longDescription": "<p>This session was given by Tom Shannon at ExCel London, London, UK on Dec. 12, 2018 in room #12 at 11:30 am</p><p>Lighting and Materials go a long way towards embellishing a scene, but you can make the experience even more dramatic with the use of post-processing effects. This lecture shows how you can use post-processing effects to improve various aspects of your scene from anti-aliasing to reflections to AO to motion blur. </p><p>This lecture also shows the benefits of using Sequencer to create cinematic pre-rendered animations. Sequencer is a tool that takes a fraction of the time to achieve compelling results when compared with traditional techniques. </p><p>Topics Covered: </p><ul><li>Post-process effects </li><li>Anti-aliasing </li><li>Bloom, glare and lens flares </li><li>Auto exposure </li><li>Depth-of-field </li><li>Motion blur </li><li>Screen space ambient occlusion </li><li>Screen space reflections </li><li>Sequencer</li></ul>",
