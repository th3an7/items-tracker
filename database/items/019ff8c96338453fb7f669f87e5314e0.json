  "longDescription": "<p>Add the temperature component to your character and give them the ability to feel hot &amp; cold!</p><p>*v2 UPDATE - Screen Effects and Hot&amp;Cold Animations added</p><p>*v3 UPDATE - Replication issues fixed, New water volume added and volume visuals in editor updated</p><p>*v4 UPDATE - Celsius to Fahrenheit logic, Day&amp;Night Cycle example, Sounds for Hot &amp; Cold states</p><p>*v5 UPDATE - Undercover logic added to negate temperature variations when under shelter (basic weather volume for snow &amp; rain included)</p><p>*v6 UPDATE - World Z Temperature override and possessable actor logic</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/kWdosR3O4CU\" rel=\"nofollow\">Demo Video</a></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/ntPcuTqHtVA\" rel=\"nofollow\">v2 Demo Video</a></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/F7yj6nph_-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">v4 Demo Video</a></p><p><br /></p><p>This easy to integrate system comes with three temperature volumes that can be added into your level(and actors) to affect the current temperature of any character that contains the temperature component. Temperature variations of the volumes are completely customisable and you can even place volumes within other volumes for more diverse conditions in your levels.</p><p>The &#34;World&#34; volume is used to create temperature zones within your level.</p><p>The &#34;Fire&#34; volume can be placed in actors such as campfires &amp; torches to heat the specified area. This type of volume wll automatically calculate how close the character is to the centre of the volume and increase the temperature as the character gets closer to the centre.</p><p>The &#34;Water&#34; volume can be placed in the level to give your oceans and lakes a more realistic feel. The deep the character ventures in the volume, the colder it gets. This volume is set to automatically compensate for the size of the volume. A small puddle or pool will have no temperature variation where as a deep ocean will get colder towards the bottom.</p><p><br /></p><p>The temperature component comes with a minimum &amp; maximum temperature range that the character can safely stay in without getting damaged by hot or cold temperatures. There are five body part variations that can be updated when the character equips clothes/armour to increase the current temperature range.</p>",
