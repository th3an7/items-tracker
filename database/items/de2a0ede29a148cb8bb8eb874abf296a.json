  "longDescription": "<p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/epic-sounds-and-fx/epic-nature-loops-demo?in&#61;epic-sounds-and-fx/sets/epic-arsenal-essential\" rel=\"nofollow\">Audio Demo</a></p><p>Nature Loops sound FX collection includes traditional and alternative points of view on the sounds of wind, water, rain, thunder and fire. This natural selection of seamless loops is a subset and included in of our <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/item/928d5410a4504c9a81d6534c05c7619e\" rel=\"nofollow\">Organic Nature</a> sound library.</p><p>The awesome power of nature is in your mix and you&#39;ll be in total control with these beautifully captured sounds. You might even think you&#39;re godlike (Yikes!). Don&#39;t let all this sonic power go to your head though. Instead, just sit back, mix it and mash it and you&#39;ll be impressed with the epic auditory experiences you can create with the Nature Loops - ambient nature sound loop library.</p><p>All files are game-ready, mastered and optimized in length, size to reduce game distributions and space. The sounds are free of clipping, always start/end at volume 0 to avoid any clicks or pops, and looping sounds are seamless. The collection is a fantastic complement to any sound designer needing to recreate organic environments or soundscapes and even includes all natural freezing rain sounds. You probably haven&#39;t seen that available anywhere else!</p>",
