If nothing is selected, the rotation will be restored from the one saved before destroying the actor.</p><p>&#43; Fixed an error causing a crash when the NPC tried to register in the World Director system without having a movement component.</p><p>&#43; The correctSpawnAxisZ setting has been changed. Now this parameter can be configured for each NPC class separately.</p><p>&#43; Small fix.</p><p><strong>Update 1.1.2</strong> - Fixed crash issue with Niagara components.</p><p><strong>Update 1.1 - </strong>Now compatible with <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/population-control-populate-your-world\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Population Control</strong></a></p><p>1. &#43; Add offset parameter to layers. This removes the shaking when the actor is on the boundaries of the optimization layers.</p><p>2. &#43; Added override the global parameters of the layers. Now you can adjust the radius separately for each actor and NPC. For example, you can spawn small objects much closer, which gives additional optimization. After all, a rabbit is smaller than a dinosaur and it is not necessary to see it at a distance of several hundred meters.</p><p>3. &#43; New events in Blueprint in your NPC BehindCameraFOV and InCameraFOV for optimization your code.</p><p>4. &#43; New optimization for NPC components now all components are optimized, not just the MovementComponent. Which adds to the performance.</p><p>5. &#43; Added support for the new <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/population-control-populate-your-world\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Population Control</strong></a> system</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Attention! After upgrading from UE 4.26 to 4.26.1, when the project starts in the editor and finishes, the editor may crash. Please see the documentation on how to get around this.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>The <strong>World Director NPC </strong>plugin is ideal for creating games where there are many pawns in the world at the same time. The level of your pawns, their location, scale, the rotation will always be preserved, as well as they will always move, even if you are very far away, which creates a simulation of the living world. You can simulate a whole world of thousands of pawns. You can create an entire populated city. The plugin is easy to use.</p><p>This is a comprehensive system for optimizing a large number of NPCs in locations. <strong>World Director NPC </strong>is perfect for creating open-world games of any size. You will no longer have to think about spawning characters and removing pawns if your character has come or gone from the place where the pawns should be. If you spawn pawns near the character and leave this place, the pawns continue to move and they do not affect the FPS. On my system with an AMD 2700X processor, I achieved <strong>200000&#43; pawns at 120&#43;FPS</strong>. When the character returns to the same location, the pawns return to the world with the same characteristics (health, level.).</p><p>Now I&#39;ll explain how it works. The system is divided into 4 optimization levels that work simultaneously for the best FPS performance. </p><p><strong>Level 1</strong> - if the pawn is out of the camera&#39;s view, all its components and skeletal meshes are disabled from the render, and a set of optimization measures is applied, such as animation playback and tick rate. </p><p><strong>Level 2</strong> - if the pawn is further away from the character than you set in the settings of The <strong>World Director NPC </strong>plugin, it is deprecated while retaining all its settings. At this level, this pawn is calculated for its position in the world, as well as finding a way to walk. The search takes place in the radius you set completely randomly. All calculations are based on your Navigation Mesh. Pawns will also bypass walls and obstacles. </p><p><strong>Level 3</strong> - If the pawn is even further away, on the border of level 3. the number of simultaneously walking pawns is further reduced for optimization. </p><p><strong>Level 4</strong> - at this level, the pawn stops moving, but still continues to exist. And if your character gets closer, the pawn gets to level 3 and starts moving.</p><p>While at level 2.3.4, pawns can&#39;t act according to the Behavior Tree, but they can still walk.</p><p>All calculations for hidden pawns at level 2.3.4 occur using multithreading for better FPS.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>World Director NPC - </strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NBaqUIFHW19zXC05BFgKYgXgX59tRuCuHK_STmuoJCg/edit?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Documentation</strong></a></p><p><strong>World Director NPC &#43; Population Control</strong> - <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LT6-_uaqMMi5iQUjMP3ljuRJk908f7Mmmvn5FX3j4bA/edit?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Documentation</strong></a></p><p><br /></p><p>All plugins for optimizing your project:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/loot-generator-full-control-on-loot\" rel=\"nofollow\">Loot Generator</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/world-director-npc-pro-now-with-multiplayer\" rel=\"nofollow\">World Director PRO</a> (included World Director Actor and World Director NPC)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/world-director-npc\" rel=\"nofollow\">World Director NPC</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/world-director-actor-just-optimize-your-world\" rel=\"nofollow\">World Director Actor</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/population-control-populate-your-world\" rel=\"nofollow\">Population Control</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/foliage-assistant-pro\" rel=\"nofollow\">Foliage Assistant PRO</a></li></ol><p><br /></p><p><strong>&#xfeff;Disclaimer</strong>: don&#39;t forget this is just an optimization tool and you need to understand why you need it.
