Inspired by Industrial artists from the 1980s through 2020 it is professionally composed, produced and edited to be custom-fit to scenes or levels easily. Every part of each track is split out into a separate loop or one-shot with filenames indicating the key, tempo and length of music - making it easy to set up an interactive soundtrack for video games. Aggressive synthesizers, guitars and drums are mixed with metallic sound design and glitchy, noisy effects. The pack also includes several tracks of ambient electronica for background ambience in the chiller moments of your game, as well as a bonus folder of gritty sound design effects.</p><p><br /></p><p>Perfect for Science Fiction, Cyberpunk, futuristic scenes, mechanized environments, rock club scenes, raves and more.</p>",
