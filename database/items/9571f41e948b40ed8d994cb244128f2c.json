  "longDescription": "<h3>My video game music pack “Open World” is my fourth pack to be released in 2024. This pack is more slow paced than my other packs and it’s perfect for questing, strategy, puzzle, farming and relaxing scenes in your Game or Video Project. Combine this pack with my packs The Adventurer, The Warrior &amp; Battle Drum Loops and you will have lots of music for your Game.</h3><p><br /></p><p>Listen to the pack here:</p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/D0YAUATMH_w\" rel=\"nofollow\">Teaser (Youtube)</a></p><p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cinematsic/sets/open-world\" rel=\"nofollow\">Track Playlist (Soundcloud)</a></p><p><br /></p><h3>This pack includes</h3><h3>10 full original main tracks</h3><h3>10 lite versions (more Ambient, Atmospheric)</h3><h3>10 loops</h3><h3>(60&#43; minutes of music in total)</h3><p><br /></p><p><strong>Sounds like</strong></p><p>Manor Lords</p><p>Farthest Frontier</p><p>Banished</p><p>Foundation</p><p>Dark Souls</p><p>Elder Scrolls</p><p>World of Warcraft</p><p>The Witcher</p><p>God of War</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>My music is Youtube-Safe and can be freely used without any concerns of copyright strikes, flags, or demonetization. This is essential when players showcase your game in videos or streams for YouTube, and other similar platforms.</p><p><br /></p><p>You will not get a copyright claim and you are allowed to use the soundtracks wherever you want and as many times as you need Royalty-Free! Use the music over and over, in any of your projects or productions, without any additional fees.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h3>The music is written, produced, mixed and mastered by me and I’m not using AI in any way while creating my music. My music is 100% made by me.</h3><p><br /></p><p><strong>Tracklist - 30 audio files </strong><em>(.wav 44.1 kHz, 16-bits)</em></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>[Main Tracks]</strong></p><p>Anxious [2:13]</p><p>Calm [2:20]</p><p>Endless [3:08]</p><p>Glorious [2:05]</p><p>Happiness [1:41]</p><p>Mysterious [2:30]</p><p>Native [2:46]</p><p>Peaceful [2:09]</p><p>Resting [1:55]</p><p>Wasteland [1:34]</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Instructions</strong></p><p>Since I don’t know how much intensity and sound effects that you will use in each particular scene I have made “Lite” and “Full” versions. The Lite versions have minimal melodies and are more background-music-like, the Full versions are with all the intended instruments. A bonus is that you can use this to extend the track and get more variations by using the &#34;lite&#34; version first, then transition into the &#34;full&#34; version and then back to the lite version.</p><p><br /></p><p>The loops are arranged after length and can be used as they are, put in a row, or put together in a lot of different combinations using the software of your choice. There is free software that can be used for this as well.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>I’m an independent music composer that loves to write music for the orchestra. I want my music to sound high quality and epic, like “Hollywood”-music, huge, dramatic and well-produced at an affordable price.</p><p><br /></p><p>I would appreciate some constructive criticism and suggestions. It is you as a game developer or video editor that (hopefully) will be my customer and I want my music to serve your project as well as possible. </p><p><br /></p><p>Customer satisfaction is my highest priority so if you have any questions don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m also very interested to hear about the game or project that you used my music in, and I would love to listen, play and share it on my social media if i may?</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you so much for supporting me and my music!</p>",
