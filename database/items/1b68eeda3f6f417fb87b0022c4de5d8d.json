  "description": "Mesh Ops Lite is a collection of 100+ Blueprint functions written in C++, Mesh Booleans, Mesh Generation and much more!",
  "longDescription": "<h2>This is the Lite version of Mesh Ops, which has fewer functions than the full Mesh Ops Plugin <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/84e127de57ed4e12877b1337b4e25ad1\" rel=\"nofollow\">which can be found here</a>!</h2><p>Notably, functions involving selection, brushes, icon generation, mirroring, smoothing (and others) have been trimmed out for this Lite version. Over 100 functions including Mesh Booleans, slicing, extruding splines, importing/exporting obj, saving/loading data are all available still in the Lite version. Compare the functions lists for more details. The full Mesh Ops Plugin also receives updates and new functions from time to time, the Lite one will only get bugfixes. Almost everything is named the same between versions so If you need to upgrade to the full plugin, it should be possible to swap the plugin folders but this is currently untested.</p><p><br /></p><p>Some of the following information and links may reference features in the full plugin, please look at the functions list or <a href=\"mailto:vyrulentstudios&#64;gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">email us</a> if you have any questions.</p><h2><br /></h2><h2><a href=\"https://youtu.be/IQsq99kfLtE\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>OVERVIEW VIDEO</strong></a></h2><p><a href=\"https://vyrulent.com/MeshOpsDemo.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>DEMO MAP DOWNLOAD</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://vyrulent.com/CutGameDemo.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>&#39;CUT GAME&#39; DEMO DOWNLOAD</strong></a></p><p><br /></p><p>Mesh Ops Lite is a collection of 100&#43; Blueprint Node Functions written in C&#43;&#43;, allowing for a wide variety of advanced Procedural Mesh edits and generation. Included are several example blueprints of how to chain together these nodes to accomplish many different things. Most functions are construction script tested/safe (when used as intended, please backup your work.)</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsQYyYcol61E0mugdalhhaA\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Youtube</strong></a><strong> </strong>We may provide tutorials in the future, stay tuned.</p><p><strong>4.26 / UE5 / Questions / Requests - </strong><a href=\"mailto:vyrulentstudios&#64;gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">vyrulentstudios&#64;gmail.com</a></p><p><strong>Documentation (Auto Generated from full plugin) </strong><a href=\"https://vyrulent.com/MeshOps/Documentation/MeshOpsPluginBPLibrary/MeshOpsPluginBPLibrary.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://vyrulent.com/MeshOps/Documentation/MeshOpsPluginBPLibrary/MeshOpsPluginBPLibrary.html</a></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>INCLUDED DEMO GAME</strong></p><p>&#39;Cut Game&#39; is included as an example of how this plugin could be integrated into gameplay. Roll around and slice into the floor as you go, once you cross back over your path it cuts out a section of the floor for a limited amount of time. The goal is to knock as many point spheres into the holes you make as you can within the time limit, green spheres are worth points, red subtract from your total points, and blue spheres increase the remaining time.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The Mesh Boolean function and some of the related code are from an engine plugin called Geometry Processing, included in Unreal since 4.26, but not exposed to blueprints on its own. If you only need the mesh boolean functions from this, I would recommend another (free) plugin from gradientspace.com - https://github.com/getnamo/RuntimeGeometryUtils</p><p>(Gradientspace is also a great resource to learn about the Geometry Processing plugin, not affiliated/associated) Mesh Booleans on simple meshes are very fast - enough to be done in real-time, i.e. every frame, but for more complex meshes it takes much longer, we provide methods to save and load the data so it doesn&#39;t have to be generated at runtime, or regenerated.</p><p><br /></p><p>Most of the functions operate on an entire mesh at once and/or use a loop of vertices - fine mesh &#39;modeling&#39; type editing is not available in the Lite version and currently limited in the full version.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>QUICK START</strong></p><p>You should be able to right-click in a blueprint and type Mesh Ops, to find all the nodes available. Mesh Data is the structure that holds procedural mesh data.
