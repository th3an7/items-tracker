  "description": "An easy to use AI Sense letting you flag allies to help and enemies to attack.",
  "longDescription": "<p>The Ally Assist AI Sense plugin helps you enhance your AI by providing an easy way to feed them ally and hostile actors to perceive. Whether you have an AI medic looking for allies to heal or a vehicle under heavy enemy fire that needs to call for help from a guard tower, this plugin gives you an easy to use sense to provide them with them with that data.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: </strong>A C&#43;&#43; project will be required to use this.</p><p>Due to a crucial engine interface not being exposed to Blueprints (Specifically IGenericTeamAgentInterface) this plugin will not work with a Blueprint-only AI project as you have no way of setting/getting team ID&#39;s. You will likely find that this a problem with developing a Blueprint-only AI project in general.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Adds a new AI Sense, Ally Assist, that can be configured seamlessly alongside other senses in AI Perception components.</li><li>Actors can &#34;Request Assistance&#34; from AI within a specified broadcast range, letting them know about itself and/or the hostile harassing them.</li><li>Using the provided Blueprint node or C&#43;&#43; static function keeps things simple.</li><li>Customizable perception ranges allow you to control when actors will be perceived/no longer be perceived.</li><li>A minimalistic implementation gives you only what you need and no bloat.</li><li>As an engine plugin it&#39;s easy to use in multiple projects.</li></ul><p><br /></p><p><strong>Examples of Usage:</strong></p><ul><li>A player under attack by a sniper needing AI Mortar support.</li><li>A vehicle that gets hit by a missile requiring healing from a nearby healing tower.</li><li>A player that spots a high value target amongst enemy forces for their AI allies to attack.</li></ul>",
