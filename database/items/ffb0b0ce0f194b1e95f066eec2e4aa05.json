  "description": "Male, female, and child mannequins of average body type for development and prototyping purposes",
  "longDescription": "<p>A pack of 3 mannequins – male, female, and child – for development and prototyping purposes. These mannequins are fully rigged to the Epic skeleton and can use the skeleton that comes with the starter content/animation starter pack for fastest setup (just assign the skeleton to use it!) or have other animations easily retargeted.</p><p><br /></p><p>Included Materials can easily be changed to color-code the mannequins to create a whole array of easily identifiable characters while prototyping - enemies/friendly characters/quest givers/etc.</p><p><br /></p><p>These mannequins were created primarily with the intention to make prototyping easier, but naturally they can be used for any purpose, even as background props (dark/light wood with brass materials would come especially useful here)!</p><p><br /></p><p>Both male and female mannequins would work out of the box when assigning a new skeleton, but there are a couple more steps to prepare the child mannequin in order to use the starter content skeleton correctly – see the “Additional/Important notes” section.</p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p><ul><li>3 characters: male, female, and child (of average body type).</li><li>2 parent materials with 4 material instances per character, including: dark wood and brass, light wood and brass, plastic and aluminum, and smooth plastic and metal.</li><li>Exposed TintColor parameter in a parent material for easy labeling of different mannequins.</li><li>Fully rigged to Epic skeleton – works with starter content with minimum setup, easy to retarget and use other animations.</li><li>3 LOD levels.</li></ul><p><strong>Scaled to Epic Skeleton</strong>: Yes</p><p><strong>Rigged</strong>: Yes</p><p><strong>Rigged to Epic Skeleton</strong>: Yes</p><p><strong>Animated</strong>: No (Featured and Thumbnail images show the mannequins posed outside of UE4 (still rendered in UE4), the Gallery image shows direct use of the Male mannequin running animation from the Third Person Shooter template)</p><p><strong>Number of Characters</strong>: 3</p><p><strong>Vertex Counts of Characters</strong>: 43k tris (additionally, LOD1: 30k tris, LOD2: 21K tris)</p><p><strong>Texture Resolutions</strong>: 2K (2048x2048)</p><p><strong>Supported Development Platforms</strong>: Any</p><p><strong>Supported Target Build Platforms</strong>: Any</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Important/Additional Notes</strong>:</p><p>While all mannequins are rigged to the Epic Skeleton, the child mannequin is shorter than the default mannequin - male and female mannequins can use the default skeleton asset from the animation starter pack or starter content to get you up and running in moments, but the child mannequin will require another step for animation retargeting. Information on animation retargeting can be found in the Unreal Engine 4 Documentation and only takes a few clicks in this case.</p>",
