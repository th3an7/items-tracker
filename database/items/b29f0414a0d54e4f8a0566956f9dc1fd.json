  "title": "Naatur Plugin: Asset Scattering With Physics Simulation",
  "description": "Spawn a bunch of actors naturally in your scene without drag-and-dropping from content browser into viewport!",
  "longDescription": "<p>The Naatur Plugin is a custom editor mode to ease environment design. This plugin is used to scatter assets using the built-in Unreal Engine rigid body physics simulation. The Naatur plugin is not only meant to enhance realism, but can also be used for unnatural environments as the simulation can be run, paused and scattered actors can ignored simulation altogether. This is meant to give you more control over how scattered assets interact with the environment. This makes the plugin good for both realistic and stylized environments. Also, since simulations are in editor, you can still drag and drop actors from the content browser into the viewport, move actors around in the viewport and they will still interact with simulating actors flawlessly. To give you even more control, you can assign a Physical Material to the assets in the palette and each spawned actor will have that Physical Material and react accordingly with the environment. You can equally choose if scattered actors will be static or movable at runtime. All these in a few clicks. If you are familiar with the foliage mode, you will feel comfortable with Naatur mode as they share similar UI and functionality. This will prevent new users from having to re-learn the new tool. Simply drag and drop assets into the palette and start painting. Also, Naatur can be used in sequencer for games. Just create a Naatur Sequencer Actor, add assets to spawn and attach it to an event to use in sequencer.</p><p><br /></p>",
