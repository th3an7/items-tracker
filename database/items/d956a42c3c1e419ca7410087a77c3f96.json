  "description": "This framework provides a full visual novel system with choices, conditional branching, a layered character system, and much more.",
  "longDescription": "<p>Combine the power of UE4 with the narrative depth of a visual novel! This VN Framework provides a full visual novel system that can be integrated with your 3D or 2D environments and gameplay.</p><p><br /></p><p>Watch the trailer here: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/bGWhDZ4N4kY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/bGWhDZ4N4kY</a></p><p><br /></p><p>These Blueprints have already been used for published games and result from the efforts of Woodsy Studio, which has been building visual novels in UE4 for approximately 2 years. This system is designed to handle large-scale scripts with branching, choices, level changes, and more.</p><p><br /></p><p>I know what it&#39;s like to write a script as a simple document and then go through the painful process of converting it to code. This framework vastly simplifies that process. You just have to convert your script into a spreadsheet, then upload it as a datatable. After that, you can take full advantage of the VN Framework to add animated characters, cinematic camera angles, and more to your scenes!</p>",
