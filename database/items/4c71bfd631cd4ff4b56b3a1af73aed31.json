  "description": "CryptoNet protects your game against network-based hacks, by encrypting replication!",
  "longDescription": "<p>CryptoNet encrypts your game&#39;s network traffic (all the things that are replicated, both RPC and variables) to prevent hackers from exploiting its network traffic. As CryptoNet works on top of replication, you don’t have to modify any of your game&#39;s code. Just plug it in, configure it, and your game&#39;s network is now safe!</p><p><br /></p><p>CryptoNet is built to resist eavesdropping (hackers can&#39;t read your network traffic) and MITM attacks (hackers can’t alter your network traffic). As CryptoNet was made with modularity in mind, you can tweak the encryption parameters, and choose how secure you want your game to be. This way, the security level perfectly fits your needs, in terms of both performance and security.</p><p><br /></p><p>The plugin is provided with encryption that should be strong enough for most games. So, even if you don&#39;t know a lot about cybersecurity, you can be assured your game will still be secure, even with the defaults settings.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you like CryptoNet, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/Evols/CryptoNet\" rel=\"nofollow\">star it on Github</a>!</p>",
