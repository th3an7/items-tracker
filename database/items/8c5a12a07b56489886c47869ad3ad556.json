  "longDescription": "<p>MidBlob is a fully physical, TPS or FPS controllable slime character, monster, minion, parasite for UE4 and UE5&#43;.</p><p>MidBlob is also middle sized slime of the Blob series. please see comparison chart in preview images.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Blob series are physically dynamic slime monsters with rich feature set. They can be used as FPS or TPS characters; can mount other characters and control them (parasiting). In other side, blobs also have real time dynamics to mimic liquid-jelly like slime body. On top of all, a last beauty touch comes with gorgeous looking material.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3WxzAWN\" rel=\"nofollow\">- Playable DEMO.</a></p><p>- Fully physical skeletal mesh with 6 physical asset presets for different looks like jelly or liquid. all 6 assets comes with 3 thickness variants so there is 18 physical assets in total.</p><p>- 44 Animations.</p><p>- Can Parasite/control over prey.</p><p>- FPS mode (Slime vision).</p><p>- Liquid-like looking Advanced material with rich settings.</p><p>- New and Improved/modified Blueprint. as previous slimes blueprints, its for player and prey. but its now cleaner and better optimized. This Bp&#39;s allows you to use features like: Relax/Stiff your slime, Target and attack to take control over prey, Switch to FPS mode, Change material color and Play a selected animations and change speed for them. Key maps can be found in demo level, on the side wall.</p><p>- Relax/stiffness HUD for better feedback and understanding.</p><p>- Physical assets are additionally build for 3 versions of UE 4.26, 5.0 and 5.1. it&#39;s because each of this UE versions are simulating physics differently</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Blob&#39;s fictional backstory:</p><p>Blob&#39;s are dangerous and Cosmos-like looking slimes. But this Deep beauty is the “last thing to see” for their preys. But Blobs are also parasitic monsters that can take control over preys. so if preys are lucky, they can be chosen for being a host. If slime prefers to use its prey as host, preys can stare to this cosmos for long time, until they become absolutely tired or fully absorbed.</p><p>… and also &#34;lucky traveler&#39;s handbook&#34; has a all-known passage about this blobby slimes: “if you think you found all beauty of the deepest night sky under the your feet, you are welcome to all darkness of personal hell of you.”</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/BlobCompChart\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blobs Comparison chart</a></p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZxDdCoCQ2pQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video preview of UE4, UE5 UE5.1</a>&#43;</p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/ipCUQIknlMU?t&#61;1100\" rel=\"nofollow\">Material details for all blob characters</a></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>important to know: </p><p>- All previews are rendered in unreal engine 5.1</p><p>- Physics are different in UE5 because of physics engine change. <a href=\"https://redirect.epicgames.com/?redirectTo&#61;https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/unreal-engine-5-migration-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PhysX and Chaos Physics Systems </a> physics also changed in 5.1 after chaos engine getting own bug fixes.<u> </u></p><p>- Translucent materials (water-glass) needs ray tracing for better results with refractions.<a href=\"https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/RenderingAndGraphics/Materials/HowTo/Refraction/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> About refraction</a>.
