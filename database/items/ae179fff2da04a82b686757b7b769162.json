  "longDescription": "<p><strong>Resonance Vol. 3: Starside</strong> is a collection of modular loops and stingers designed for maximal customization and reusability. The music predominantly features choir and strings, with some brass, piano, and synthesized elements.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/limitbreakaudio/sets/resonance-vol-3-starside\" rel=\"nofollow\">Track Previews</a> | <a href=\"https://limitbreakaudio.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f1dfSZva1WuMr2sHWQ0GZX6xCgPt1mxX40emJcj1TDo/edit?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Documentation</a></p><p><br /></p><p>There are <strong>four modular tracks plus nine stingers</strong>. Each of the four tracks are broken into smaller components that can be rearranged in many different permutations. Cues can be curated into a desired play-order, randomized, or controlled by branching logic. Information for all components can be found in the documentation.</p><p><br /></p><p>Almost all cue components are comprised of <strong>2-5 instrument layers</strong> that can be controlled independently for additional dynamic variation. Adding or removing layers allows the same music to be used in many different contexts without sounding exactly the same.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Includes Resonance Music System (RMS) example implementation. </strong>The RMS is a customizable music sequencer that has been tailored for Resonance music packs, but can also accommodate music of similar design. Curated and randomized examples of modular implementation are included. Open the Resonance test map to listen to the example implementation and interact with dynamic layers.</p>",
