  "longDescription": "<p>Overview Video: https://youtu.be/bEOrzYbij_Y</p><p>Basic AI Starter to build your own AI off of. The Base AI character blueprint is set up with all the functionality to roam around on it&#39;s own or patrol between locations, and chase the player! A playable character is included as well with a health bar HUD and ability to take damage from AI. Player Character is also able to &#39;die&#39; in the form of a ragdoll death. With these blueprints, you can add more functionality as you wish, change variables, and delete AI states as needed for your project. For example, the chasing feature may not be needed for an NPC character that will have no interaction with your player. AI patrolling can be used to have a linear path for characters that the player may need to follow for a quest or simply used as an enemy patrolling an entry way. You may also choose to remove damage from being applied to have a follower character.</p><p>The basic HUD will display player health and can be added to or removed entirely from the player BP.</p>",
