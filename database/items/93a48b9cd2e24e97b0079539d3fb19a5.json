  "longDescription": "Video: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/vfw-BnMTsGQ\">http://youtu.be/vfw-BnMTsGQ</>\n\nThis pack contains realistic crosswalk and traffic light models which use dynamic materials for functionally illuminated signals. Included Blueprints provide automated setup of complex signal sequences and feature actors with preconfigured arrangements of traffic lights, crosswalk lights and mounting frames.\n\nAll models feature materials with detailed PBR texture maps. Models also have at least 3 levels of detail with LOD distances preset for optimized rendering.\n\nAssets: \n8 Traffic Light Variants - 2, 3 and 5 bulb configurations\n1 4-way Flasher\n10 Traffic Light Mounting Frames\n1 4-way Traffic Light Mount\n2 Crosswalk Lights\n3 Crosswalk Mounts\n2 Crosswalk Switches\n1 Street Lamp Light Housing\n2 Street Lamp Poles\n1 Traffic Camera\n1 Traffic Camera Mount\n23 - Traffic Light Frame Blueprints - various light arrangements\n8 - Intersection Blueprints - common arrangements of traffic light frames\n\nAll traffic light models come with 3 color variations black, yellow and green for the housings.\nDetailed user manual with descriptions and illustrated procedures for using and modifying the various assets.",
  "technicalDetails": "●\tPhysically-Based Rendering\n●\tCollision\n●\tLODs (all models have at least 3 LOD meshes. Larger meshes have 4 LOD meshes)\n●\tNumber of Meshes: 33 (32 prop/prop components, 1 demo terrain) \n●\tNumber of Materials and Material Instances: 60 (3 masters, 57 instances)\n●\tNumber of Textures: 114\n●\tDocumentation Included\n●\tNumber of Materials: 60     (3 masters, 52 primary props, 4 demo props, 1 template street sign)\n●\tDo Materials derive from a Master Material with instances as variation: Yes  (3 masters, 116 instances)\n●\tNumber of Textures: 114  (104 props, 6 demo terrain, 1 demo street sign, 3 placeholder)\n●\tTexture Resolution (complete list):  See TrafficIntersectionPack_AssetDetails.xls workbook\n●\tNumber of Blueprints: 72  (65 actors & subclasses, 1 function library, 5 data, 1 enum)\n●\tList of Features: Most Blueprints are complex arrangements of other actors, such as a traffic light frame with a series of traffic and crosswalk lights. Others are data containers and logic for cycling lights.\n\nMost of the place-able Blueprint actors are compound arrangements of functional child actors. Several common traffic light arrangements are provided for traffic light structures and some complex intersection layouts. The content package has been designed to be modular so that users can make and modify custom traffic light/intersection arrangements. The provided PDF user manual explains how to set parameters for intersections and light cycle timing. It also provides information on how to customize actors and models. Please also note that textures and materials were created with exaggerated wear & tear for typical game aesthetics and appeal. ",
