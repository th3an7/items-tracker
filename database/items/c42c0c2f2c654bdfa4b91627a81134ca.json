This way the settings are kept even after quitting the game.</p><p>All settings in the UMG Widget are built based on a DataTable. This gives endless possibilities to change the widget with easy steps.</p><p>Just create a new entry, enter the needed commands (for command line) and, on button press, your action takes place.</p><p>Every change only takes effect as soon as the ok/accept button is clicked. (Ok &#61; Accept and close) If the window is closed before changes are applied, the old settings will be restored.</p><p>Everything is built with Blueprints and is well commented, so you can simply build more functionality on top of it or integrate the widget into existing projects.</p>",
