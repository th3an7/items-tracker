The pack contains tracks suitable for any type of projects that fits the puzzle/quiz game theme. Of course the only thing that’s stopping you using it elsewhere is your imagination.</p><p><br /></p><p>I recorded the pack in the period between July 2020 to October of 2021, 40&#43;hours of recording and mixing the tracks. All tracks are tested in various situations like headphones, pc and tv speakers and mixed to have a good sound in all of them. Loops are also tested and work without clips and pops. Loops are also being written in a way that the player cannot easily tell when the loop starts or ends. Files are in wav format at 16 bit, 44100Hz. </p><p><br /></p><p>For any questions or custom music for your game visit <a href=\"https://www.pdkmusic.com/services.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><u>pdkmusic.com/services.html</u></a></p>",
