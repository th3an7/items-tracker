Traces remain not only as deformation on the material, but also in the form of decals and also markers with any information (for example, his height, age, weight) about the player and the NPC. You can leave a huge number of footprints and over huge distances. Multiplayer and WorldPartition supported.</strong></p><p><strong>The material for Lanscape uses Nanite Tessellation, is perfectly tuned and matches the textures from Quixel Bridge. You can simply replace the textures with the ones you need.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Attention: For the vehicle blueprint to work in the demo scene included in the plugin, you need to enable the &#34;Chaos Vehicle Plugin&#34;</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Key implemented features:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Realistic operation of the footprint system.</strong></p><p><strong>2. Ability to work over long distances. If you go 1 km away from the deformed areas and return, the tracks will still be in place.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Ability to set individual settings for each NPC or object.</strong></p><p><strong>4. The ability to track a target and distinguish some tracks from others by markers.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Information markers, support goal information and unique icons for the goal. Feel like a hunter.</strong></p><p><strong>6. Even vehicles can leave traces. And yes, you can find the player who stole your car.</strong></p><p><strong>8. You can shoot, throw grenades and all this deformation will remain.</strong></p><p><strong>9. Multiplayer and WorldPartition supported.</strong></p><p><strong>10. Excellent optimization of the system itself.</strong></p>",
