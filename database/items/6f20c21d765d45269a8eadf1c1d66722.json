  "description": "10 seamlessly loopable, authentic 8-bit chiptune music tracks designed for retro style and pixel art games.",
  "longDescription": "<p>This pack contains 10 seamlessly loopable, authentic 8-bit chip tracks (16-bit wav files) and 20 mins, 22 secs of original music.</p><p><br /></p><p>In this pack all tracks are produced to be as authentic sounding as possible and conform to the limitations of the time. While my previous 8-bit pack incorporated use of additional sound channels and subtle use of basic modern effects (EQ, reverb, delay etc.), this pack eschews all of that for tracks that sound like they were pulled directly from those retro game systems! This makes it a perfect asset for retro/pixel art style games; particularly those with a fantasy slant or a “blobber”, turn-based, RPG/dungeon crawl approach. “Point-and-click” style graphical adventure games will also get great use out of these tracks. Included in the tracklist are hub world themes, travel themes, area exploration themes, and fight themes. Some tracks include a version with and without the use of the noise channel for percussion.</p><p><br /></p><p>You can listen to the music pack in full before purchasing here:</p><p><br /></p><p>https://soundcloud.com/aleksis_tristan_shaw/sets/8-bit-graphical-adventure</p><p><br /></p><p>TRACKLIST:</p><p>Tavern Meeting, v.1 (with noise channel) [2:08]</p><p>Tavern Meeting, v.2 (no noise channel) [2:08]</p><p>Travel Theme [1:46]</p><p>Lost in a Cavern [2:08]</p><p>Monster Attack [1:42]</p><p>Creature Fight [1:51]</p><p>Bustling Town [2:29]</p><p>Traversing the Map [2:08]</p><p>Exploring the Dungeon [2:23]</p><p>Harrowing Battle, v.1 (no noise channel) [1:35]</p><p>Harrowing Battle, v.2 (with noise channel) [1:35]</p><p>Evil Lurks [2:08]</p>",
