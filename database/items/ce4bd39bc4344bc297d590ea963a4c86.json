  "description": "Highly customizable system to build trains, roller coasters or anything that runs on a track. Parent carriages to form trains, derail them on sharp bends or disable realistic features to create stylized effects. 100% Blueprint and easy to extend.",
  "longDescription": "<p>Overview video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;HtADtIsoB1w\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;HtADtIsoB1w</a></p><p>Documentation (features, overview and breakdown of all Blueprints): <a href=\"http://polygonjelly.com/products/unreal/trainandrail/docs/TrainAndRail.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://polygonjelly.com/products/unreal/trainandrail/docs/TrainAndRail.pdf</a></p><p>Product homepage: <a href=\"http://polygonjelly.com/products/unreal/trainandrail\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://polygonjelly.com/products/unreal/trainandrail</a></p><p><br /></p><p>Build complex or simple train tracks in minutes, then preview them instantly. Trains can be customized for any setup, look or feel. </p><p>Tracks are spline based, allowing you to setup complex meshes quickly. Also included is the terrain train track for quickly building tracks across uneven terrain. Track triggers allow you to have trains or carriages fire events in the game world. Use triggers to create junctions that change, or level crossing barriers that lower as a train approaches, or leaves. </p><p><br /></p><p>The mine cart comes with a custom jump trigger that uses built-in events to extend the base carriage, allowing the mine cart to jump, rotate and scale into the air for comic effect. Each carriage can detect obstacles on the track and respond accordingly, some can stop and wait for it to move, others can ignore it and keep on going. End of track options give you the ability to define how the train or carriage responds to the end of the track; stop, reverse direction, derail, .., or add your own custom response.</p><p><br /></p><p>The system comes with a pre built mine cart, modern train engine, and two example carriages. </p><p>The system is highly customizable and comes with documentation, examples and videos.</p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Blueprints: 9 (&#43;6 Demo blueprints) </p><p>Maps: 8 Example maps, 1 overview </p><p>Models: 19 (6 Train, 2 mine cart, 2 coaster, 3 tracks &amp; 6 demo models) </p><p>Number of Materials: 14 </p><p>Do Materials derive from a Master Material with instances as variation: Yes </p><p>Number of Textures: 15 (4k for train, 1-2k for demo models) </p><p><br /></p><p>Features </p><p>All blueprints commented and with helper comments on where to extend sections </p><p>Documentation provided for all major blueprints including detailed descriptions of every component, macro, function and variable</p><p>Train Carriage </p><p>Select a track in the world and the carriage (or entire train if parent) will snap to it </p><p>Customize entire look &amp; feel all meshes can be swapped out</p><p>Highly configurable engine / physics: friction, gravity, mass, acceleration, deceleration as well as max speed, min speed </p><p>Collision filtering, E.g. ignore the player pawn </p><p>Customize the derail force, higher &#61; more interesting crashes </p><p>Timed collision ignore list for each carriage </p><p>Parent carriages pass their settings down to the child (can be disabled) </p><p>Ability to specify how far apart child and parent carriages should be </p><p>Distance checks can be enabled and the child can disconnect from the parent if the distance is too great </p><p>By default all carriages come with the Lean Effect and the Roll Effect (the mine cart has a custom jump effect) </p><p>Lean Effect, ability for the carriage to lean on or out of a bend, creating a cartoon lean effect </p><p>Roll effect is used to derail a carriage if it goes around a bend that&#39;s too sharp. </p><p>Events for post update to carriage as well as enter and leave each section of track</p><p>My original feature list is too long, check out the public documentation for more details and features.</p>",
