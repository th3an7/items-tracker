How to make sure tens of different NPC guards pick a random cue for greeting, attacking or saying a catchphrase? This character voice system is the solution!</p><p><br /></p><h2>Key Features</h2><p>This system is very extensive, the core features are as follows:</p><ul><li>Initialize Character Voice via animation notify</li><li>trigger a fixed dialogue by an event like an overlapping box or when a pawn sees an enemy.</li><li>Voices are set up in an actor component, therefore you can drag it onto your character</li><li>Predefined voices of Feminine, Masculine, and &#34;Epic Boss&#34;</li></ul><p>Predefined fixed dialogue categories include:</p><ul><li>Jump</li><li>Health</li><li>Buffed</li><li>Suffered</li><li>Killed Enemy</li><li>Level</li><li>Combat</li><li>Emotion</li><li>Pain</li><li>Mana</li><li>Choice</li><li>Cooldown</li><li>Use</li><li>Breathing</li><li>Status</li><li>Team</li><li>Effort</li><li>Ability</li></ul><h2>Basic and Advanced components</h2><p>The core of this system is to initialize fixed character dialogues. But to show all capabilities of this system it also includes some other systems on a basic level. These basic systems are just here to showcase how the product can be used and are not intended to be the core of this system. However, due to these basic systems, the integration is flawless with my other systems.</p><p>Don’t worry, if you do not want to use my other modular assets, it is no problem. You can use the basic integrations as an example of how to integrate into your own.</p><p><br /></p><h2>Extended Movement Component</h2><p>This system includes a basic “Extended Movement Component”. It is capable of</p><p>·        Handles player inputs via the Enhanced Input System. It uses input mapping and I have included an advanced method for handling and dynamically linking and unlinking mapping contexts.</p><p>·        Provides a central place for the replication of montages, particle effects, spawning actors and sounds.</p><p>·        Is full of useful functions related to your character: Switch Global orientation between strafing and forward-facing character, Define Gender, get active camera component, and more</p><p>·        Manages the camera of the player.
