  "title": "Videshi's French Guillotine",
  "description": "This is a reasonably low-poly realistic guillotine, fully animated, with several material variations to suit your stylistic needs. Perfect prop for a horror or medieval-fantasy themed environment.",
  "longDescription": "<p>This is a reasonably low-poly guillotine largely based off of old French blueprints found by the artist. The model is based upon these original designs, animated, and given highly-detailed PBR materials. Several additional detailed materials have been added to suit your thematic needs: standard wooden, mouldy, old/dusty-mouldy and a blood material that can be used with blend nodes to lay on top of the others (example included in project). These materials can be mixed and matched in blueprinting to create additional combinations.  </p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features:</p><ul><li> A guillotine and rope static mesh/animations, as well as individually laid-out meshes should you need to create, for example, un-assembled pieces on a table.  </li><li>Guillotine and rope use five materials. With three main material sets, and one blood material that can be laid on top of these materials as an extra detail. An example material displaying how to blend the blood layer in is included in the project&#39;s material directory.  </li><li>A rope animation and blade animation, as well as animation blueprints for both. The inclusion of individual meshes allows you to create your own within the engine.  </li><li>An example map with the main asset and material variations laid out in 4k resolution, set to the Unreal Marketplace standards. Example level&#39;s ground material is from Epic&#39;s free starter content.  </li></ul><p>Texture Sizes:</p><ul><li> 4096/2048/1024/512</li><li>Three textures per material, with ambient occlusion, roughness and metallic contained within an individual texture&#39;s RGB channels.  </li><li>Materials use the base colour, metallic, roughness, normal and ambient occlusion channels. There are four material “sets”, with 4096, 2048, 1024 and 512-sized versions, for a total of 80 materials.  </li></ul><p>Scaled to Epic skeleton: (No)</p><p>Collision: (Yes: Auto-Gen]</p><p>Vertex Count: 9,735</p><p>LODs: 1</p><p>Number of Meshes: Two combined/animated, and ~80 individual parts.</p><p>Number of Materials and Material Instances: 62. No instances pre-made, but materials organized for instancing.</p><p>Number of Textures: 240, including all size variations.</p>",
