Learn how to enable actors in the game to &#39;hear&#39; and respond to in-game audio, discover how to drive parameters by analyzing the audio&#39;s amplitude and frequency, and use your player&#39;s microphone to create immersive experiences. Imagine driving leaf animations based on the sound of the wind, instigating a camera shake based on the frequencies of an explosion, or having in-game actors react to the music track. Apply this to the player&#39;s microphone to create even more exciting opportunities. Have your player start a fire by blowing on their microphone, conjure a magic spell using their voice, or even attract the attention of nearby NPCs by whistling.</p><p><br /></p><p>The ability to use audio analysis to drive in-game events and parameters based on the audio itself has endless creative applications. Let&#39;s get started!</p>",
