  "description": "CoreKit Components is a series of Actor Components that enable you and quick and easily add optimized functionality to your game!",
  "longDescription": "<p>CoreKit Components consist of <u>NINE</u> fully functional feature components. Each component is self-contained and accessed through either an event dispatcher or interface. Demo and Examples are set up to show how the use the systems as well as placeholder hookups to plug into your save/load system.</p><p><br /></p><p>Demo Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;vf4R4FeMmt4</p><p><strong>NEW </strong>Door Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;c7GPRp-VrCE</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Note: This is a component asset pack intended to be migrated and hooked up into your project. Although the documentation is detailed, a basic understanding of Blueprints is needed to align it with your needs.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>For discussion and support join our Discord at: https://discord.gg/RnjMBRhYVh</p><p><br /></p><ul><li><strong>New in V1.1 - Doors! The Door Actor allows you to quickly and easily create rotating and moving doors that start and go in any direction. One-way doors or doors that always open away from you. Locked doors. Also includes an optional handle setup to make the door feel more immersive.</strong></li></ul><p><br /></p><ul><li>Quest Component: The quest component allows you to quickly and easily set up quests with multiple stages and tasks via a Data Table. Quests are set up to run through the Condition Component, allowing you to create unique functionality anywhere in your game.</li></ul><p><br /></p><ul><li>Dialogue Component: Attach the dialogue component to any NPC or Actor, giving them dialogue when interacted with. Dialogues are driven from a Data Table and can include multiple messages and replies. Messages and replies can also be hooked into the Condition Component to provide unique dialogue and options based on user progression.</li></ul><p><br /></p><ul><li>Power Component: The power component can be attached to any actor giving it the ability to be a Power Manager, a Power Source, or a Power User. Power Managers are central hubs (For example a power plant) that contain their own base power and bring in power from sources and users within a range. Power sources (For example a solar panel) add power to a power manager. Power users (For example a workbench) use power from a power manager. The system contains a &#34;smart&#34; setup that will ensure that if there are multiple Power Managers in an area, a source will pick the one with the most load to get it up and running again and a user will pick the one with the least load to not overload things. If a manager is destroyed, it will attempt to transfer its sources/users to another manager in range. This entire system works off a single component and has no timer/tick functionality, it only runs when updates are made. It also does not require any save/load under basic usage.</li></ul><p><br /></p><ul><li>Trait Component: The trait component allows you to create, via a Data Table, leveled traits that can be used for various things. For example, you could reduce the stamina cost of jumping the more you jump or increase your strength attribute after chopping down a set number of trees. This system supports any number of levels, direct links into gameplay tags (for attributes) as well as just a wildcard benefit that can be applied however you&#39;d like.</li></ul><p><br /></p><ul><li>Condition Component: The condition component is a relatively simple but powerful system that stores a map of keys that can be queried through an interface. When a key is changed, an event dispatcher is called that can be used to trigger whatever setup you&#39;d like. You can use this system to, for example, advance quests, spawn items, or change dialogue.</li></ul><p><br /></p><ul><li>Interaction Component (Lite): Basic functionality for interacting with objects in the world. Can be added to any actor and includes the ability to enable/disable interaction, execute any functionality on interaction, and display UI elements.</li></ul><p><br /></p><ul><li>Attribute Component (Lite): A basic attribute set up in order to show off the Trait system. Uses Gameplay Tags for attributes and can be expanded on quite easily.</li></ul>",
