  "longDescription": "<p>Blueprints to measure distances and area&#39;s.</p><p><br /></p><p>These blueprints are meant to be used during the blockout fase of a level.</p><p><br /></p><p>LMI_Ellipse -&gt; Measure the area and the circumference of a circle/ellipse</p><p>LMI_Rectangle -&gt; Measure the area and the circumference of a rectangle</p><p>LMI_Ruler -&gt; Measure the distance between 2 points</p><p>LMI_Route -&gt; Measure the distance between 2 points with a spline, which is configurable. With this blueprint you can set a path through your level. It will show you the distance, but also the time a player would need to follow this path. The speed a character can have can be set in the settings. Set this to the maximum speed of your character! You can add multiple markers on the path. For instance on half the length (50%). This is very usefull for instance when 2 teams should arrive at the same moment in a particulair place in the level. It helps you setup the choke points and where geometry should be placed to force a player to take a certain path. Or in singleplayer to make sure multiple paths in a level are the same by distance and/or time. When timings are important in your level (multiplayer and singleplayer) this is a very valuable tool. No more endless playtesting with a stopwatch only to make sure the timings and distances are correct. More time to focus on the gameplay!</p><p><br /></p>",
