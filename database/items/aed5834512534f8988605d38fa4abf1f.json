  "description": "A package to help you create maps in your game. The map widget is highly customizable visually and in functionality, working as a minimap or a fullscreen map, with lots of other options.",
  "longDescription": "<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;Iuxnp_63yXM&amp;\" rel=\"nofollow\">Demo Video</a></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>This package contains a series of assets allowing for the creation and implementation of customizable maps in your game that can scale well with highly detailed map textures even in large game worlds. This system works similar to Google Maps, loading only the parts of the map your are currently looking at into memory, and being able to load higher resolution textures as you zoom in to specific parts of the map, but not when zoomed out and looking over a large area. Besides the main map widgets, there is also a tool that can save a top down view of your game world from above, split up into numerous grid pieces, and at varying resolutions automatically. For the final map textures you could use these ones as is, or modify them to match a desired style, or make them completely from scratch yourself.</p><p>The map widgets also support some basic other features such as showing markers for other actors in the world, such as friends, enemies, the player them self, or objective markers.</p><p><br /></p><p>The map is highly customizable allowing you to make it look like whatever you need for your own game with the ability to easily update the appearance of it with your own art and textures. Zoom buttons, compass, and other features are similarly modifiable.</p><p>All aspects of this product have a large number of options to help make sure that you can get the package to do what you want it to as often as possible. Flexibility is key for easy and fast development, as while it might take more time to learn all of the extra options present and how to use them, it will take much less than otherwise implementing such options or features yourself would.</p><p><br /></p><p>Older Notes: Currently does NOT work in the 4.26. In 4.27, it will not work reliably when played in Viewport, but does work if played in new window, or in built projects.</p><p>There are some cases of it also having issues with play in viewport in 5.0-5.4 versions so far, though not all get them. In general, playing in new window still seems to work though.</p><p><br /></p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features:</p><ul><li> Grid based map supports loading different tiles on the fly to minimize performance costs, while maximizing texture quality.</li><li> Return system that can add widgets to the map to represent actors or objects in the world on the map, with an in built team system for handling returns differently depending on their relationship to the map user.</li><li> Main map widget includes options for zooming, re scaling the map widget to any size even during run time, ability to automatically center on a source actor, or to be centered and moved independently of the source actor, options for visuals, and many many more.</li><li>A camera actor that can easily take orthographic top down pictures of your entire map, and save them to the desired folder locations with options for varying resolutions, file name structures, and much more to make it as easy as possible to make your maps.</li><li>How To Use Video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;EV4xBJeV9SY\" rel=\"nofollow\">Part 1</a> of 2.</li></ul><p>Number of Blueprints: 3 Widgets, 8 Demo Widgets, 2 Scene Components, 2 Actors, 6 Demo Actors, 2 Structs, 1 BPI, 1 Enum.
