  "longDescription": "<p>Samples of this pack can be found here: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-46083621/galaxyofterrorreb-sam\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://soundcloud.com/user-46083621/galaxyofterrorreb-sam</a></p><p><br /></p><p>My sounds for this pack were inspired from the movie by the same name. Classic B rate flick. The music in it was awesome, at least to me. This pack has some of the same feeling as that generation did on sound. I didn&#39;t expect to make a pack such as this, it just happened from experimenting with unique sounds, and this is the result. Don&#39;t get me wrong, these sounds were hardly thrown together. This is a complete collection of a unique mood for a space like game or even a horror based game.</p><p><br /></p><p>The sounds are moody, and timeless. I tried to bring the on-edge feeling of what the music for the movie did for me years ago. Now, after months of work, you have a complete collection of sounds and moods for your game or project. This would even fit a small indie film if you wanted to go that route. I hope you enjoy the pack as much as I did creating it.</p><p><br /></p><p>Sounds in this collection:</p><p>There are 18 movie like moods with 2 follow up ambient that i felt would be good in the pack. 20 total custom built sounds, created from the ground up.</p><p><br /></p><p>Please visit my Marketplace listing <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/William&#43;Zettler\" rel=\"nofollow\">located here</a> to view other packs I have at the Marketplace that might fit your project as well!</p>",
