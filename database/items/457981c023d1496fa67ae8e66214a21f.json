  "longDescription": "<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;5eJchSsHC3Q\" rel=\"nofollow\">NEW TRAILER </a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;aooQOPU1Lk8\" rel=\"nofollow\">OLD TRAILER</a> (landscape materials are not included in this pack)</p><p><br /></p><p>All my REAL-WORLD heightmaps/terrains, including this one, are UNIQUE on Unreal Engine Marketplace because:</p><p><br /></p><ol><li>I use real-world data with the best possible resolution (most of the cases 1 meter horizontal precision and about 30 cm vertical precision). Resolutions higher than this are not possible because of the current technological limits.</li><li>I am the only one who&#39;s real-world heightmaps PRESERVE the real-world SCALE</li><li>My real-world heightmaps are not procedurally generated in some kind of software like World Machine or Gaea where a heightmap can be generated in minutes. Instead, I use pretty complex manual methods to transform the High Resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEM) into heightmaps which are in the end perfect copies of real terrains/landscapes. Because of this, creating a single real-world heightmaps can take up to 3 hours.</li><li>My real-world heightmaps are the only heightmaps from UE Marketplace which simultaneously respect all the above statements.</li></ol><p><br /></p><p>This pack contains 226 heightmaps which will help you create real world landscapes from Alaska. 164 heightmaps have a 4033 X 4033 resolution and each can be used to create 400 square km landscape, while 62 Heightmaps have a 2017 X 2017 resolution and can be used to create 100 square km landscapes. The heightmaps are created from Digital Elevation Models with 5 meters precision. This pack is also a mixture between real world heightmaps (118) and modified real world heightmaps (108). The modified heightmaps are Alaska original heightmaps, enhanced with small details in such a way that the overall shape of the landscape remains about the same.</p><p>The heightmaps can be used for creating realistic landscapes in games, movies, cinematic trailers etc.</p><p><br /></p><p>Step By Step instructions of how to integrate the heightmaps into your level:</p><p><br /></p><p>1. Install one of the FREE plugins: &#34;Export PNG&#34; or &#34;ILIAD&#34;</p><p>2. Select in the Content Browser the PNG heightmap you want to use in your project</p><p>3. Right click on the selected PNG texture (heightmap) and select Asset Actions - Export (or ILIAD Actions - Export, in case you are using ILIAD)</p><p>4. Save the PNG heightmap to your hard disk (keep the same PNG format)</p><p>5. Open the map you want to import the heightmap into and select Landscape Mode</p><p>6. Choose option Import from file and select the previously exported PNG file</p><p>7. In order to keep the exact proportions of the real landscape, in the name of every heightmap you can find the X, Y and Z scales for that heightmap. For example, in the filename Alaska_1a_XY_500_Z_194 , the X and Y scale is 500 and Z scale is 194. So type the correct XYZ scales and then press Import to import the heightmap into your level.</p><p>8. Done! In a few seconds you should see the landscape...</p><p>This pack contains 5 Demo Maps.</p><p>If you prefer procedurally generated heightmaps instead of real world heightmaps, check my other packs <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/Mathew81?count&#61;20&amp;sortBy&#61;effectiveDate&amp;sortDir&#61;DESC&amp;start&#61;0\" rel=\"nofollow\">HERE</a></p>",
