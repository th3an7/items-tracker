  "longDescription": "<p><em>Example down-mixed to binaural and explainer found on YouTube</em> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1JKLIiMzdFs\" rel=\"nofollow\">HERE</a></p><p>This music pack would fit well in a dark science-fiction or cyberpunk aesthetic. It is mixed in ambix 3D audio format and can be used in VR or any first-person perspective and is capable of panning in all directions.</p><p>The pack includes 4 &#34;horizontal&#34; layers, which can be thought of as scenes. Each horizontal layer has been composed as to be able to fade to any other horizontal layer in a pleasing way.</p><p>Each &#34;horizontal&#34; layer has 4 &#34;vertical layers, these can be thought of as stems and are intended to be mixed on top of one another. Each vertical layer can be played by itself or in any combination.</p><p>I have generated a cue for each horizontal layer that will play all vertical layers at equal levels as well as cues for each vertical layer. It is up to you how you wish game play to modify the interaction of each vertical layer, if at all. With some interaction with game play, it will be impossible to hear the exact sounds twice.</p><p>All audio is 24bit/44.1k, 4 channel ambix. Each horizontal is a 10-minute loop with 4 vertical layers. there is a bonus theme song in binaural stereo that is also 10 minutes.</p>",
