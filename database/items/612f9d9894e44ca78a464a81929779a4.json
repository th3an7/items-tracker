  "longDescription": "<p>If you&#39;ve found some foliage(trees/rocks) that don&#39;t work well on slopes - this package is for you.</p><p>In particular, an ugly open edge on the base of a tree/rock sticking out, and either having to sink all items into the ground, or carefully just the ones on the slope</p><p><br /></p><p>This addon is designed to fix exactly that issue.</p><p>The lowest group of verticies are compared to the ground and moved down to ensure they are fully hidden</p><p><br /></p><p>Instructions:</p><ol><li><strong>Run </strong>the widget (<em>content/FloatingFoliageFixer/FoliageFixer</em>)</li><li><strong>Tick </strong>the types of foliage you want fixed</li><li>Press <strong>fix</strong></li></ol><p>If you change your foliage in the foliage editor, press <strong>refresh </strong>before re-using the foliage fixer</p><p><br /></p><p>Actions that re-apply foliage positions (such as undoing a manual move of a foliage item) will reset foliage locations - if this happens you must re-apply the fix to that foliage type.</p><p><br /></p><p>Only tested on windows, but should run anywhere UE4Editor runs.</p><p>Performance is around ~20000 foliage instances every 10s on fairly complex foliage.</p><p><br /></p><p>Assets *not* included, just the foliage fixer</p>",
