  "description": "This is a full 2d Grid-based navigation system with Npc Ai that can navigate it independently with different behaviours.",
  "longDescription": "<p>I needed a 2d Grid-based navigation system for a game I&#39;m making myself, but it didn&#39;t exist and it can&#39;t be done with base engine components like the NavMesh.</p><p><br /></p><p>That&#39;s why I made this.</p><p><br /></p><p>It&#39;s meant for projects that use tile-based, 4-directional navigation (up down left right), across which AI can move Npc&#39;s. This is fully controlled via blueprints, rather than the navmesh and character movement component which don&#39;t allow for this type of grid-based movement.</p><p><br /></p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features:</p><ul><li>Fully made in Blueprints.</li><li>It&#39;s very fast and can handle multiple Npc&#39;s and the Player moving at the same time easily.</li><li>The pack contains an example map made made with the available tiles.</li><li>Has a Player Pawn that navigates terrain in the same way (WASD or arrow controls).</li><li>Npc&#39;s will avoid moving over each other and the Player.</li><li>Different navigation behaviour over terrain like Swimming tiles, One-way tiles and Obstacle tiles.</li><li>AI moving around static obstacles and prefers to avoid Swimming/Obstacles over other, slightly faster but longer routes.</li><li>Does not contain Behaviour Tree. Can&#39;t get that to work smoothly with the Navigation.</li><li>Easy input of new locations, already connected to an example Database.</li><li>Outputs added to allow you to customize behaviour and fully control animations.</li><li>Easily enable/disable the ability of an Npc to move over specific tiles.</li><li>Made in Unreal Engine 4.26, though will likely work in older versions too.</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Number of Blueprints: 3 (Npc, Player, Navigation Broker)</p><p>Input: Made with Keyboard inputs, but you&#39;re free to change it.</p><p>Network Replicated: No.</p><p>Supported Development Platforms: All.</p><p>Documentation: Most info is in the comments. If there are any questions, feel free to contact me.</p>",
