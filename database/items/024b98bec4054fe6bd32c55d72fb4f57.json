  "longDescription": "<p>Hello!</p><p><br></p><p>I hope these models will add some creative fun to your games and cut a few hours off from your development timeline. Please shoot me a message if you'd like any changes made and for requests on future packs.</p><p><br></p><p>The scale of these explosives should be nearly perfect to within one millimeter of the real deal, so I think you'll get a kick out of just how small the anti-tank mine is when compared to the anti-personnel explosives.</p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features:</p><ul><li><strong>POMZ-2 steak grenade</strong> with removable pin. This isn't the stick grenade that's thrown, it's made specifically for tripwire traps.</li><li><strong>PMD-6 box mine</strong> with removable pin. This is another tripwire explosive.</li><li><strong>I.E.D. claymore</strong>. This is a remotely detonated improvised directional explosive seen by military personnel in several countries.</li><li><strong>155mm artillery shell I.E.D.</strong> with removable improvised hacksaw blade sensor. The sensor can be placed away from the explosive device for remote activation. I considered using the ball-bearing sensor, which is more common, but the hacksaw blade sensor looks more interesting.</li><li><strong>Bouncing Betty</strong> or S-Mine. </li><li><strong>VS 2.2</strong> anti-tank mine. </li><li><strong>VALMARA 69</strong> anti-personnel mine. There's a hole in the middle spike for tying a tripwire.</li><li><strong>OZM-72</strong> anti-personnel mine with two removable pins. The top pin is the safety and the bottom pin is for the tripwire.</li><li><strong>Toe Popper</strong> or Cartridge Trap. The ground sculpt is removable.</li><li><strong>Tellermine</strong>. Modeled after the '42 version.</li></ul><p>Texture Sizes: All 2K</p><p>Scaled to Epic skeleton: Yes</p><p>Collision: Yes, automatically generated</p><p>Vertex Count: 3,000-13,000</p><p>LODs: 0</p><p>Number of Meshes: 10</p><p>Number of Materials and Material Instances: 10</p><p>Number of Textures: 4 texture maps for each material, 40 overall. </p><p>Supported Development Platforms: Specifically made for UE4</p><p>Supported Target Build Platforms: Also UE4</p><p>Documentation: docs.unrealengine.com</p><p>Important/Additional Notes: If you have tried online documentation and still have questions then leave a message and I'll try to help you out.</p>",
