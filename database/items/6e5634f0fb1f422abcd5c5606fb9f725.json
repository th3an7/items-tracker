  "longDescription": "<p>This music pack features 10 original piano pieces to reflect a lazy Sunday. Each piece captures a certain mood or feeling that is the name of the piece such as the warm sunrise, the cold morning frost, or the quiet drizzle of rain on a Sunday afternoon.

Each of the 10 pieces were composed by myself with much time, thought and care.</p><p><br /></p><p>You can listen to a preview of the 10 tracks here: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-692864948/soft-piano-music-pack-sampler/s-lbNb7W5Xnbb?si&#61;0cf0a32e739141658671002175d6fbef&amp;utm_source&#61;clipboard&amp;utm_medium&#61;text&amp;utm_campaign&#61;social_sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Soft Piano Music Pack (Sampler)</a></p><p>You can also listen to the full Album on Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/4F8JxBuGkHdaOgvXHzrrC5?si&#61;nIB3XX3nQC-btQim8-xR1A\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunday</a></p>",
