  "description": "This basic toon shader kit allows you to implement toon shading in your projects easilly using Material Instances, and can easily be extended with new features via Material Functions.",
  "longDescription": "<p><strong><em>4.19 Changes: </em></strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong><em>- Gradient system used in 4.16-4.18 have been replaced with a new system for shading (Due to the old system&#39;s shading color affecting the entire material, and due to weird dark artifacts that happened). The toon-step system has been taken out, until I can release a new update which will re-implement it.</em></strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong><em>- Determine shading color based off a texture. This will offer more versatility for shading.</em></strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong><em>- Basic outline P.P has been added, which won&#39;t change size based on screen resolution. More changes are coming, and it should only be used in an WIP manner, due to some issues that need to be resolved</em></strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong><em>- P.P solution for those who are only interested in the deferred renderer (while still wanting shadows), is being worked on. More info will be shared soon, and it&#39;s basic in functionality, but this will be expanded upon.</em></strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong><em>- Roughness, metalic, and specular have temporarily have been taken out, due to some issues the emissive nature of the shader.</em></strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Features:</p><ul><li>Control over shading color, material texture (or material color if using flat colors), and all sorts of other parameters through material instances</li><li>Multiple shading modes, including TOON Gradient (Which uses a gradient system and vector light for shading), TOON Self-Shadow (Which uses the directional lights in the level to determine shading and shadows, and is best for objects that require it and environments), and TOON Unlit (Which is a simple unlit shading mode, which should only be used for flat-shaded objects)</li><li>Modular nature, since individual components use their own material functions</li></ul>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p><strong><em><u>FAQ:</u></em></strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How will this toon shader look on my stuff?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> It honestly depends on if your 3D model&#39;s normals were built with a toon shader in mind, Examples being stuff similar to games like TLOZ:TWW, GGXrd, DBFZ, etc. If not, it will probably look awful due to the shading using the model&#39;s normals to decide how things are lit.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Why should I spend money on this?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> The setup for toon-shaded objects with this pipeline has been streamlined to making a single material parameter and setting up your properties in it. It is far more convenient than creating a pipeline yourself, and it&#39;s cheaper than the $50-100 post-process solutions already available which give you subpar results.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong><em><u>Number of Materials:</u> </em></strong>3-4</p><p><br /></p><p><strong><em><u>Do Materials derive from a Master Material with instances as variation:</u></em></strong> Yes</p><p><br /></p><p><strong><em><u>Supported Platforms:</u></em></strong> Designed for Desktops, but can be used with Mobile platforms (Since it doesn&#39;t use any post-processing), and could be used with Consoles aswell (Although untested).</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Documentation (Will be updated when new updates are released):</strong> </p><p>https://github.com/Bryceless/BasicToonShader_Manual/wiki</p>",
