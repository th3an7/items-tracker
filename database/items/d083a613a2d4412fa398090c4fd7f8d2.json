They can be used with or without tessellation, the height map, AO, etc. The master materials and instances are all made so you can easily adjust them, as needed.</p><p><br /></p><p>All materials have a color/roughness, ambient occlusion, height, normal map, and wet map textures.</p><p><br /></p><p>The textures can be adjusted between 32 and 4096 max resolutions (currently set to 2048 for ease of use and mobile requirements), and the material instances have parameters for all textures, road line color, wetness, color hue, roughness, normal strength, height distance, and tessellation amount.</p><p><br /></p><p>There is an asphalt and concrete version for each clean, worn, damaged and divoted road type, as well as single and double lanes for each. There are also slightly worn and damaged omni tiling materials for multiple uses.</p>",
