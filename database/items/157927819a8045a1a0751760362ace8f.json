  "longDescription": "Preview: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;Pa4-komodZ4\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v&#61;Pa4-komodZ4</a><br /><br />The automatic asteroids pack features one main blueprint that allows you to control all aspects of the asteroid to generate. The asteroid composition is based on 16 different detail base meshes with 4 level of details ranging from 40,000 down to 800 triangles and unique handcrafted height maps. The creation and material settings of the particular are asteroid can be said to quickly generate huge asteroid constellations without the need for manual tweaking. There are 16 different material presets available from the blueprint and the complete number of 24 texture sets to choose from. All textures are available in a 4K, 2K, 1K as well as 512 pixel version in order to allow the user to select the best resolutions for his game. The texture distribution is driven like in my other works by analyzing the mesh and height data. The asteroids look detailed in extreme close-up but also works from great distances. This pack is designed for DirectX 11 or equivalent platforms. It uses the DX11 tessellation feature in order to drastically boost the visual quality of the asteroid in a close-up view. This pack also includes a basic environment space sky background sphere and is an all in one solution where all things are controlled from the blueprint. There is no need for any art or design to use the Asteroids in a game. Physics based simulation is also included as well as destructible meshes however both things require an integration in to the user’s game design and game code.",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>There is also a backwards compatibility to SM4 and DX 10 but this strongly reduces the overall visual presentation. Hence this presents not the desired target platform.</p><p><br /></p><p>The destructible meshes are also included however their use is not implemented in the blueprint since it is closely related to the type of game and gameplay and therefore not part of this general solution in the main blueprint.</p><p><br /></p><p>This pack includes the following assets:</p><p>• (99) unique textures 486 in total.</p><p>• (2) blueprints</p><p>• (35) static meshes / destructible meshes</p><p>• (7) materials and 33 material instances</p><p>• (4) levels / maps</p><p><br /></p><p>Intended Platforms: Desktop, Console, VR</p><p>Important\\Additional Notes: This pack works in UE 4.10 and higher versions.</p><p><br /></p><p>Support: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/eTMMYSr\" rel=\"nofollow\">discord </a></p>",
