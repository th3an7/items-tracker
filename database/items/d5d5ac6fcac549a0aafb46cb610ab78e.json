The Loops serve for some time when the weapon is fully charged, or simply for a heating alarm, there are several uses. And Pitch Shift sounds can have hundreds of applications.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Ease</strong></p><p>The sounds were made to think of a facilitator for you, there is no need to edit them or keep correcting anything, just implement it in the game and run the WAV, that&#39;s it, you already have a great sound effect in your game, ensuring all the difference in just a few steps.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Helping each other</strong></p><p>When you invest in this package, in addition to taking all the aforementioned things, you still help and motivate me to continue creating new materials for developers.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>License</strong></p><p>non-exclusive license – you’re free to use these packs in your commercial games. No license to claim/resell as your own work.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Bonus</strong></p><p>There&#39;s a folder called &#39;bonus&#39; this sounds are used in layers in another sounds from this package, they&#39;re great but not with alot of layers so i decide not to charge for them :)</p>",
