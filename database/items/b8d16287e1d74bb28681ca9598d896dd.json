This collection offers 20 hand-crafted jump scares and 50 eerie stingers, blending orchestral and electronic elements to create a versatile and dynamic sound palette. Additionally, the pack includes 90 unique stingers derived from the original 50, using experimental post-processing techniques to produce fresh, unpredictable variations.
