This plugin greatly widens the possibilities of blend-ins and blend-outs through built-in interpolation for all camera shake patterns. ECSP Plugin also introduces a brand new type of pattern which is run by Vector and Float curves, thus together with enhanced Wave Oscillator pattern and enhanced Perlin Noise pattern, provides a great tool to craft any camera shake for every possible scenario.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Core Features:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Interpolation for Blend-Ins and Blend-Outs for all Camera Shake Patterns - </strong>Blending can now be interpolated through easing functions thus, making smooth transitions between camera shakes way better.</li><li><strong>Wave Oscillator’s Frequency Blending - </strong>Wave Oscillator’s Frequency can now slowly accelerate and decelerate on start/stop.</li><li><strong>Wave Oscillator’s Phase Shifting - </strong>Wave Oscillator’s Initial Offset can now be set manually to exact value.</li><li><strong>Curve Shake Pattern</strong> - Brand new pattern that uses Runtime Vector and Float curves to manipulate the camera&#39;s Location, Rotation and Field of View. </li><li><strong>Randomization for Curve Shake Pattern</strong> - Curve shake pattern can automatically choose a random “Curve Set” from its array of Curve Sets based on their weighted probability, thus, making the process of creating random procedural camera shakes way easier.</li><li><strong>Parameter Mapping for Oscillator-based Patterns</strong> - <em>Introduced in 2.0 Update.</em> Camera Shake Oscillators’ Amplitude and Frequency values can be set dynamically on runtime by mapping a float parameter to each Oscillator. All Oscillators have their own vector curve that defines how Amplitude and Frequency values will change based on the mapped float parameter, thus, simplifying the process of creating camera shakes that directly react to float variables, for example player’s current movement speed.</li></ul><p><br /></p><p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This is <u>not</u> a complete camera shake system solution, you still need to write your own logic for starting and stopping camera shakes based on your specific needs. Example implementation of that can be found in the example player character blueprint provided by the plugin.</p><p><br /></p><p>Not sure if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for?
