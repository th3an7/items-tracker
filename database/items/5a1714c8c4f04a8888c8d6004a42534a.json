  "description": "A Simple 2D AI system for Flock Movement of Birds/Fish/ECT",
  "longDescription": "<h2>A Simple 2D AI system for Flock Movement of Birds/Fish</h2><p>Craig Reyonds published a conference paper that described the movements of flocks in a set of 3 simple rules. </p><ol><li>The members of a flock tends towards its center</li><li>The flock aligns its rotation</li><li>The flock tries to not overcrowd its self</li></ol><p><br /></p><p>These were referred to as Cohesion, Alignment, and Separation respectively. The goal being to create a realistic looking emergent movement system for birds/fish/cows where each agent, called a boid, makes its own decisions. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Ahead based Collision Detection</h2><p>This allows the Boids to swerve to move around an obstacle without bumping into it, giving a natural curve to their movement patterns.</p><p><br /></p><p>The asset provides the Behavior tree, Actor, and AI Tasks for a developer to get a 2D flock system working instantly.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/dro4hj9_xPk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Youtube Trailer</a></p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features:</p><ul><li>8 BP including the Boid Actor</li><li>Commented and easy to understand BPs</li><li>Behavior Tree and Blackboard</li><li>Scale-able performance</li><li>Out of the box customization of Speed, Rotation, Swarm size</li><li>Ahead based collision avoidance</li><li>Silky smooth 60fps on swarms of 40&#43;, with the game tread staying below 10ms. Actor-driven swarms are always going to be performance-heavy, this component tries to mitigate that and give the developer as much control as possible! (Stats collected on an i7-7700HQ)</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>V1.1 adds</p><ul><li>An attractor actor that pulls the swarm towards a central point if they are within the radius.</li><li>A repulser actor that pushes the swarm away.</li><li>An additional demo level with a fish pond example.</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Number of Blueprints: 10</p><p>Input: NA</p><p>Network Replicated: <strong>No </strong>* Nothing is stopping a developer from replicating the actors. However, I would encourage them to consider the network performance of replicating this many actors.</p><p><br /></p><p>Supported Development Platforms: Windows</p><p>Supported Target Build Platforms: Windows</p><p><br /></p><p>Documentation:</p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/dro4hj9_xPk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Youtube Link</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uwUuCyArz1epwjmFlk8n-rkO8CuHw4wrn1CvWv7mHNw/edit?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Support Doc Link</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/SeamusRyan/20180528/318927/Creating_realistic_Swarms__Boid_Movement.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gamasutra Article Link</a></p><p><a href=\"https://forums.unrealengine.com/unreal-engine/marketplace/1491580-simple-ai-boid-flock-movement\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marketplace Forum Thread Link</a></p>",
