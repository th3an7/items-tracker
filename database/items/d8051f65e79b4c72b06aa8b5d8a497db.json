Starting with simple audio volumes we will look at how matching your reverb to the game spaces can help immerse the player in the reality of a space. We’ll look adding layers of detail to your sounds over distance and how to implement occlusions systems for a more realistic feel to your audio. The course will help you understand and choose the most appropriate relationship between the camera and the listener and how you can use listener focus to draw attention to important features in your level. With destructible assets increasingly becoming the norm the course will also cover how to make your audio dynamically respond to changes the game environment.</p>",
