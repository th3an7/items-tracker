This pack was crafted with the intention of infusing a touch of magical charm into your finishing moves! Included in this package are Power Ready sounds, designed to notify you when your special magic attack is primed and ready. To wield its power, simply initiate one of our Swings followed by a Magic Blade Slash to unleash a formidable magical melee attack. While some of our sounds feature subtle distinctions, they are crucial for creating a lifelike experience and preventing noticeable repetition in fast-paced combat scenarios.</p><p><br /></p><p>* <em>Explore our technical information section and SoundCloud previews to discover everything you need before making the exciting decision to add this pack to your collection!</em></p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cyberwave-orchestra/sets/sword-magic-magical-melee-combat-attacks?si&#61;9426aec853d4463ca154f8e230040a4f&amp;utm_source&#61;clipboard&amp;utm_medium&#61;text&amp;utm_campaign&#61;social_sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">SoundCloud Preview</a></p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/13aBxc-YrDO0QuAbgABbw5o20kuR3qosT/view?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Included Files List</a></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><strong><u>Need More For Your Fantasy Game Combat:</u></strong></p><p>Need <strong>magic spells </strong>attacks?

Each sound effect features properly applied Fade-In and Fade-Out effects to ensure smooth and natural transitions. All sound effects are maintained below -1 dB to prevent audio overload when multiple sounds are triggered simultaneously. Our Swing sounds are perfectly synchronized, allowing any of them to seamlessly replace each other without the need for adjusting start times. This synchronization holds true for Blade Slash and Power Ready sounds as well. Our mission is to deliver high-quality sound that cuts through background music, immersing your players and sending shivers down their spines.</p>",
