  "description": "We are proud to present AAA quality SFX pack that features 30 unique monsters and creatures (295 sound effects combined), and 12 spawning sound effects. The innovative format we used to bring them to life will ensure a top-notch realism to any game.",
  "longDescription": "<p>The research and work were enormous for this sound effect pack! By listening to suggestions from the developers, the following format was used for each monster and creature: Idle, Charge, Target Hit, Hurt, and Death. Depending on how many variations these have, we divided them into Simple, Basic, and Advanced categories.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cyberwave-orchestra/sets/ultimate-monsters-and-creatures-sound-effect-pack?si&#61;1c0f6b27b339426cb940977094c66e9e&amp;utm_source&#61;clipboard&amp;utm_medium&#61;text&amp;utm_campaign&#61;social_sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">SoundCloud Preview</a></p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OpkD3crHUMGFK8Kkh10BFIgMxqemchpM/view?usp&#61;share_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">All Files List </a></p><p>This product is a part of our big <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/1ddec00060e247f3a78521d36e8d1119\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Fantasy Bundle #1</strong></a></p><p>This product is a part of our affordable <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/083a18ade3fa448c85bff9271745e96a\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Monster Slayer Bundle!</strong></a></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>WHAT&#39;S INCLUDED?</h2><p><br /></p><ul><li>13 Advanced M&amp;C: 3X Idle, 3X Charge, 3X Target Hit, 3X Hurt, and 2X Death.</li><li>7 Basic M&amp;C: 2X Idle, 2X Charge, 2X Target Hit, 2X Hurt, and 1X Death.</li><li>10 Simple M&amp;C: 1X Idle, 1X Charge, 1X Target Hit, 1X Hurt, and 1X Death.</li><li>12 Monsters and Creatures SPAWN sounds.</li></ul><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>WHAT DO THE ACTIONS MEAN?</h2><p><br /></p><ul><li><strong>Idle: </strong>The basic sound when the monster is undisturbed.</li><li><strong>Charge:</strong> When the monster attacks! This does not mean that the attack hits the player of course (If the player dodges for example), which is why there are no strong impact layers in the Charge sound effects.</li><li><strong>Target Hit:</strong> This action is used when the monster hits the player. It is shorter than Charge, with a strong impact.</li><li><strong>Hurt: </strong>This can be triggered when the monster takes damage. The impact is very subtle in Hurt sounds so that it wouldn&#39;t clash with the player&#39;s weapon of choice sound effect.</li><li><strong>Death: </strong>The sound of the final blow when the creature dies.</li></ul><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>USEFUL TIPS:</h2><p><br /></p><ol><li>Make use of the multiple variations in the <strong>Basic</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong> categories. By randomly rotating between the variations, you increase the realism and avoid the machine gun effect. This is perfect for creatures that appear a lot in the game, or in large groups. Our <strong>Simple</strong> category has no variations, but it&#39;s great for occasional encounters. Of course, there are no rules here!</li><li>When the monster or creature attacks, you can use the <strong>Charge </strong>action. If the attack connects, trigger a <strong>Target Hit</strong> sound. <strong>Charge</strong> and <strong>Target Hit</strong> sounds overlap well, but you can experiment further by fading out the <strong>Charge</strong> sound when the <strong>Target Hit</strong> kicks in.</li><li>You can trigger <strong>Spawn </strong>and <strong>Idle </strong>sounds at the same time for a cool effect!</li><li>If your monster (Humanoid for example) has a weapon, layering it over <strong>Charge</strong>, or <strong>Target Hit </strong>sounds can give great results.</li><li>As mentioned before, there are no rules set in stone here. You can mix actions from different creatures to make your own creations.</li><li>It&#39;s all about triggering these sounds at the right time in relation to each other, or in relation to other sound effects that you use. Sometimes they won&#39;t match your visuals perfectly right out of the box, but that&#39;s where you need to tweak everything patiently until you get what you need, and the results will be amazing.</li></ol><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><ul><li><em>We appreciate hearing from our buyers and value your feedback!
