  "description": "A fun customizable material that is based on a Magical Girl Transformation.",
  "longDescription": "<p>This material is a fun magical girl transformation effect. Use it as either a base or overlay material. It comes with two types of transformations, one where you can fade the material on and one where the material is able to slide up the model. It also comes with a simple Outline Material that can enhance the Magical Girl Transformation look, although they are separate materials.</p><p><br /></p><p>See my Shader in Action here - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;AdXKvm_KewI\" rel=\"nofollow\">On Youtube</a></p><p><br /></p><p>This Material is extremely customizable through its Material Instances. The main components of the material are two sets of RGB masked stripes and randomly appearing stars. The user has a lot of control over the textures being used, the colors being used, brightness, direction, speed, ext. There are 6 Material Instances already created that can be used for an example of the shader in effect. There is also an example level that comes with the content and a free static mesh of a bigfin squid that shows off each material instance.</p><p><br /></p><p>It should be noted that the shader is based in World Space. This means that the material will go over seams! :D This can be changed in the material, but we suggest keeping this in mind when it comes to shifting a character. World space has positives and negatives upon application.</p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features: (Please include a full, comprehensive list of the features of the product)</p><ul><li> One Magical Girl Transformation Shader with a basic Opacity value.</li><li> One Magical Girl Transformation Shader with a up down Opacity Value (Adjust a value to slide the shader onto the model).</li><li>One Static Mesh of a BigFin Squid used to showoff the shader. Users are welcome to also use the static mesh in their creations.</li><li>One Basic Outline Material used to enhance the look of the Magical Girl Shader.</li><li>Two Basic Example Materials that hold grid patterns to help show how one could use the Magical Girl Transformation Shader in action.</li></ul><p>Number of Unique Materials and Material Instances: 6 Materials, 13 Material Instances</p><p>Number of Textures: 4 textures</p><p>Texture Resolutions: 2024x2024, 500x500, 512x512</p><p>Supported Development Platforms:</p><p>Windows: Yes</p><p>Mac: Untested</p><p>Documentation: In Example Map Level</p><p>Important/Additional Notes:</p><ul><li>The Pack contains Shaders, so ideally they would work for most platforms. They have not been tested in VR, but would most likely work as a base material. Overlay materials in VR may be unwise for optimization reasons, but a clever Material Artist should be able to use this material in most settings.</li></ul>",
