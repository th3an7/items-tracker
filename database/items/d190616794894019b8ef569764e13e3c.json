  "longDescription": "<p>Top Down RPG Camera provides an easy to use system for top down camera controls. It is designed primarily for games in which you control a single character from a top down perspective, as is often seen in classic ARPG games.</p><p><br /></p><p>Watch the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-JlFnSCiyxY\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Showcase Video</strong></a></p><p>View the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRyGYhd1l8CqtrJ3UxRJB8c6QcBuYmmTpcnXzK1ByFnr8VXuiy6klhdejPAbrJKSz5_7WkePBVUcv_5/pub\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Documentation</strong></a> and the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQGKsKm28s71IJkdVSfB0pwRdPbSuMdy_2y7yHexi8VxwohcWXW4ufqjLAsDG_i-FvWWi90x9wLm4rF/pub\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Changelog</strong></a></p><p>Join the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/thVat7mvPS\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Discord Server</strong></a></p><p>Download the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/109NQHElULTngCcJa4GkgoL7KaA1CwtzV/view?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Demo Build</strong></a></p><p><br /></p><p>Top Down Camera provides a flexible control scheme for top down cameras, a system for fading out meshes and actors that obstruct the player’s view of their character as seen in many top down games, and a system for managing which actor that a player’s mouse is hovering and calling interface functions on such actors, but a full list of all features is provided below. Each of these systems is contained in independent components to promote a more modular design. The core logic is in C&#43;&#43; but C&#43;&#43; is not required to use the plugin.
