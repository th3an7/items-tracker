  "description": "A large collection of high quality bird and insect sound assets with blueprint functionality.",
  "longDescription": "<p>This package combines sound assets and blueprint implementation to provide the type of result you would get from an experienced audio team.</p><p><br /></p><p>This pack allows you to define an area in your project levels by creating a volume and then defining a series of values to achieve realistic environmental bird and insect sounds. You select the biome type you want to create and the number of different species of bird you want in that volume. Then you select if you want the birds to reflect day/night cycle behaviour, if you want to include insects in the volume and various other details such as tree canopy height.</p><p><br /></p><p>At runtime this system creates family groups at random locations within the volume, the sounds are triggered within these groups and trigger rates emulate bird behaviour throughout the day. (more active at dawn and dusk, less active at noon and silent at night). The system can even track seasonal cycles and birds may &#34;migrate&#34; during the different seasons.</p><p><br /></p><p>Insects are set up slightly differently but both birds and insects will surround the listener as they move through the environment. This system is particularly effective on any platform that supports spatial audio such as VR are the newest game consoles.</p><p><br /></p><p>This package has been designed to take over 20 years of game audio experience and package it into a simple easy to use plugin that will bring your world spaces to life. By combining sound assets with blueprint functionality you are provided with everything you need to create dynamic natural spaces.</p>",
