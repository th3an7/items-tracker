  "longDescription": "<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;4TQVLJpnneY\" rel=\"nofollow\">DEMO</a></p><p>This SFX pack contains 415 gunshots for Assault Rifles, Grenade Launchers, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles and Submachineguns. There are 72 different weapons, each one having 5 or 6 variations so every time when a fire is shot, a different sound is randomly chosen from the variations list. For every weapon, there is a sound cue with the necessary setup to play random gunshots. The sound cues also come with a sound concurrency rule which allows player to use automatic fire for all weapons without using audio loops or other complicated systems. Every sound was professionally mixed and mastered so the final product is very natural, realistic and immersive. This is perfect for any first or third person shooters or any other project that needs professional firearms sounds. The pack comes with a basic automatic fire system  which you can use it for your own weapons or just to test the sounds (as seen in the video above)</p><p>Check my other packs <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/Mathew81?count&#61;20&amp;sortBy&#61;effectiveDate&amp;sortDir&#61;DESC&amp;start&#61;0\" rel=\"nofollow\">HERE</a></p>",
