  "description": "An Editor Utility Widget that can render out multiple passes using the render queue subsystem for compositing externally, including AOVs such as Lightgroups, Per Light, Emissive etc.",
  "longDescription": "<p>MultiPass is a simple Editor Utility Widget that uses the Movie Render Queue subsystem to render and queue up different types of passes for compositing externally to give more control over your renders.</p><p><br /></p><p>In addition to the standard types of passes achievable in the stock Movie Render Queue, MultiPass allows for configurations that include Per-Light, Light Groups, Emissive, Fog and Pseudo Shadows (both combined and split per light or light group).</p><p><br /></p><p>This allows for greater flexibility when compositing your shots and if you are familiar with tradition Visual Effects pipelines this falls much more in line with that.</p><p><br /></p><p>Example video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;eA1OHGu27-M</p><p><br /></p><p>There are a few things to note, This does increase render times to a degree as it runs a render for each of the new passes, it isn&#39;t double the time per pass because we aren&#39;t rendering all the lights at once when using the per light or light group passes.</p><p><br /></p><p>Requires Movie Render Queue and Movie Render Queue Additional Passes Plugins to be Enabled!</p><p>Additional note, if you cancel a render while its running please open Movie Render Queue and ensure the queue is empty before running another render, as otherwise this will error out.</p>",
