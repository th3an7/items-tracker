  "longDescription": "<p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;X1KwPFXSfak&amp;index&#61;22&amp;list&#61;PLAgvMMfMQH2O1-YfsKXSwcFK2bvVg7UrP\" rel=\"nofollow\">Demo Video</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;OB69D9J7QpA\" rel=\"nofollow\">Basic Tutorial</a></p><p><br /></p><p>Auto Buffs is component that can be dropped into any actor and then can allow for one to easily send messages to that actor about changes to various values. The component itself can hold information for any number of values, be it damage dealt, movement speed, or intelligence, it doesn’t really matter. The component will simply hold onto and manage changes for the different buffs. Managing includes counting down their remaining durations, limiting duplicates of the same buff type if set to do so, and keeping track all currently applied buffs unique IDs, names, tooltip descriptions, or other parts.</p><p>The first type is Float Multiplier, meant to produce a float that you can multiply against the original value in that actor by referencing it to figure out the new final value. There is also a Float Flat type meant for storing flat value changes like &#43;10 or -5. Next is a Boolean type that will return true as long as there is an active buff present, and false if none are present (this is meant for On/Off effects like silence, EMP, or Invincible Mode). And last is a simple Status type, that is simply meant as a place to drop effects with unique IDs that don’t have any specific modifier value associated with them. Even if you have five different modifiers affecting one base stat, some timed and expiring, others not, and others needing to be ignored if duplicates or reapplied instead, this can manage all of that while feeding you the simple output modifier that all of these changes would combine to create at any given moment.</p><p>You can also have the actor notified of any changes to its buffs, with a new value sent directly along with those updates.</p>",
