Do you also want this in your game? This is the system for you!</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Key Features</h2><p>This system is very extensive, the core features are as follows:</p><ul><li>Spawn Foliage manually</li><li>Spawn Foliage via Unreal Foliage spawner</li><li>Spawn via Procedural foliage spawner</li><li>Pickup foliage and add to inventory</li><li>Berry Picking from bushes</li><li>Respawn foliage</li><li>Respawn in radius option</li><li>Do not respawn option</li></ul><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Basic and Advanced components</h2><p>The core of this system is spawning and picking up foliage. But to show all capabilities of this system it also includes a lot of other systems on a basic level. These basic systems are just here to showcase how the product can be used and are not intended to be the core of this system. However, due to these basic systems, the integration is flawless with my other systems.</p><p>Don’t worry, if you do not want to use my other modular assets, it is no problem. You can use the basic integrations as an example of how to integrate into your own.</p><p>The integration examples that are included are:</p><p>·        Basic Inventory System: pick up items and perform actions on them.</p><p>·        UI Manager: handles the creation and deletion of HUD elements. A beautiful Survival Based Theme UI is used as an example.</p><p>·        Interaction: For any interaction in the world</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Extended Movement Component</h2><p>This system includes a basic “Extended Movement Component”.
