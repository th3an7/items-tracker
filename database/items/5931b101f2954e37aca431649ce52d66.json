  "description": "Component which provides advanced sight capabilities to character based actors",
  "longDescription": "<p>Character component implemented in 100% c&#43;&#43; code which allows for easy integration of advanced sight capabilities to any character. This is useful for characters which look around but do not change orientation of their main mesh. It can also be used to fine tune sight events, such as when you want to implement a threat meter. This component accurately detects all blocking objects by raycasting against the visibility channel. You can integrate this with first person, third person or VR environments. Sight detection can be further customized with individual character &#34;hotspots&#34; so that sight events only trigger if some portion or item on a character is seen.</p><p><br /></p><p>Discord for support, questions, feedback and requests: https://discord.gg/Baf3m9</p>",
