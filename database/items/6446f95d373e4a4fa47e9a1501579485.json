  "longDescription": "<p>This plugin offers the following optimizations and tools :</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>SetDecalResponseToNoneForAllMaterials</li></ul><p>By default all Unreal materials have the decal response set to &#34;Color,Normal,Roughness&#34;. This is useful only for decals placed on</p><p>lightmapped surfaces. If your projects uses only dynamic lights, setting the DecalResponse to None will save up</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>AutomaticallySetFullyRoughToAllMaterials</li></ul><p>By default this option is off and is only meant for materials that will always have roughness &#61; 1. This option will search all materials that don&#39;t have any value connected</p><p>to the roughness output or where that value is constant or not needed like in the case of a few transparency options.</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>DetectAnimationsImportedAtResampleRateOver30FPS;</li></ul><p>This option will list all animations imported at over 30 frames per second. In some projects artist may have exported animations at unrealistic rates like say 240 FPS and then</p><p>those animations will consume a lot of memory, this will list in the output log a list of such animations and their resample rates.</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>OptimizeParticleSystems;</li></ul><p>Particle Systems&#39; lights can consume a lot of GPU miliseconds. This option will tick off VolumetricScatteringIntensity, bHighQualityLights and ShadowCastingLights options from</p><p>all Particle Systems so you don&#39;t have to search them manually in a large project.</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>DisplayMaterialParameterStats</li></ul><p>In large projects when creating a lot of materials and material instances there are situations where a specific scalar/vector parameter is not actually overriden in the material</p><p>instance. Having a material parameter instead of hardcoding that value in the material as a constant can be costly. Having a constant instead of a parameter can reduce</p><p>total shader instructions in some cases by ~14 instructions/parameter depending on how frequently it&#39;s used.</p><p><br /></p><p>Example output:</p><p>/Game/FantasyVillage/Materials/M_Puddle01.M_Puddle01 NumMaterialInstances&#61;6</p><p>Roughness 1 / 6</p><p>Color 6 / 6</p><p><br /></p><p>This material has 6 MaterialInstances, and only 1 overrides Roughness while all 6 override Color. It&#39;s safe to assume Color shouldn&#39;t be touched but you could make it so that</p><p>the overriden value from the instance is actually the default value in the material and then make that value constant, assuming you don&#39;t need any new instances of this material.</p><p><br /></p><p>LogTemp: /Game/FantasyVillage/Materials/M_MasterBlend.M_MasterBlend NumMaterialInstances&#61;4</p><p>Blend Invert Height 0 / 4</p><p>height contrast 0 / 4</p><p><br /></p><p>In this case you can go ahead and make these 2 parameters constant with the values from the base material. You&#39;ll save quite a few instructions with no visual impact.</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>AnalyzeMeshes</li></ul><p>This is a complex tool that analyzes frequent issues with assets, StaticMeshes in particular and lists them.</p><p>ScreenSizes</p><p>This will list all screensizes and triangle counts of all meshes. This can help identify issues like let&#39;s say all your trees have screen sizes 1,0.5,0.25,0.1 but</p><p>1 tree has 1,0.8,0.5,0.1 signaling that it will not change LODs similar to the other assets and will consume more GPU performance.</p><p>WrongLODOrder</p><p>This will list the meshes where LOD[n&#43;1] has more triangles than LOD[n]</p><p>ScreenSize0</p><p>This will list the meshes where any ScreenSize from any LOD is 0. All screensizes must be greater than 0.</p><p>DuplicateSections</p><p>This will list the meshes where a mesh has say 3 sections but only 1 material. This will hinder performance and usually signals a problem at export. You should merge all objects with the</p><p> same material into one prior to importing to unreal.</p><p>1LOD</p><p>This will list the meshes where a mesh only has 1 LOD. This may be intended or a forgotten asset that can hinder performance if left without LODs.</p><p>UVChannelsOver1</p><p>This will list all meshes&#39; Maximum UVChannels for each LOD level. While not an error, having more than one UV channel when not using lightmapping can consume more memory or create issues</p><p>where you&#39;re not sampling from the correct texcoord index.</p><p>ScreenSizesInvalidOrder</p><p>This will list the meshes where screensizes are not set up in descending order. For example a mesh with screen sizes 1,0.5,0.7,0.2 is in an invalid state and you should correct it.</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>MoveTextureSamplingDependenciesToVS</li></ul><p>(This option is still experimental) It will try to safely move all nodes connected to a texture sample&#39;s UV coordinates to the vertex shader. This will increase vertex shader instructions</p><p>and reduce pixel shader instructions. In most projects pixel shaders are the GPU bottleneck you need to watch out for so this option will increase performance.</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>DetectDuplicateFoliageInstances</li></ul><p>For some reason, the editor will sometimes save duplicate foliage instances in the same position/rotation. This is probably a bug and if this is the case it will show you what levels are affected</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>MoveStaticMeshesToFoliage</li></ul><p>If you have a lot of static mesh actors that you wish were turned into foliage for performance reasons, use this option. It will look into the level&#39;s foliage types and only the meshes</p><p>that have foliage types will get converted. No selection is required. If you don&#39;t have any foliage types yet, first create them and add them to the foliage type list in the foliage edit mode</p><p>then choose this option.</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>AssignLodForCollision</li></ul><p>Assigns LodForCollision on selected assets. Use ot.AssignLodForCollision.TargetLOD (default is 1) to specify which LOD to assign for collision.</p><p>This will reduce memory usage.</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>AssignOpaqueMaterialsToHigherLods</li></ul><p>Use this on selected assets to create opaque material instances where masked material instances are used (like trees &amp; foliage).</p><p>Use ot.AssignOpaqueMaterialsToMesh.StartLOD (default 2) to specify from which LOD level to assign opaque materials.</p><p>This will significantly improve performance.</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>DenanitizeAssets</li></ul><p>This option will disable nanite on all static meshes assets with a twist : Internally nanite produces &#34;replacement meshes&#34; for raytracing which typically have 1-4% of the triangles of a mesh with millions of triangles. This option fetches this percentage and makes LOD0 equal to that percentage then proceeds with adding up to 7 LOD levels up until the last LOD is under 100 triangles. Each subsequent LOD has half the screen size and half the triangles of the previous LOD.</p>",
