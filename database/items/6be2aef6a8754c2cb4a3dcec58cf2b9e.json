Tablecloth meshes are meant to be used with the table meshes. Tablecloth meshes do not have UE4 cloth capabilities, they are presimulated static meshes.</p><p>Each mesh has custom collision that was generated and customized outside of UE4. Further each mesh has an RGB map with blood (R), dust1 (G) and dust2 (B) that can be used to give the meshes a more rugged look.</p><p>Each mesh has at least 3 material instances with high customization possibilities. Included parameter groups for the default master material are Color, DustBlood, Overrides, Vcol1(R), Vcol2(G), Vcol3(B). The liquid meshes have parameters for liquid height and transition length (for the edge).</p><p>Each mesh has LOD0 to LOD3 (4 LODs) with customized distance values.</p><p>Also included are Blueprints (without implemented functionality) of each mesh and a simple table setting BP.</p><p>This pack can be used for games, architectural visualization and VR.</p>",
