  "description": "The Improved Quest System allows you to quickly create in-game quests that players can receive and complete from NPCs or from in-game events. Quest objectives can be displayed on screen and minimap/compass user widgets",
  "longDescription": "<p>The Improved Quest System allows you to quickly create quests, set up complex quests consisting of completing any number of different quest objectives, as well as multiple consecutive quest steps. Quest objectives are shown on the player screen and user widgets. Compass, quest log and <strong>texture-based minimap</strong> user widgets are included.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Texture-based minimap</strong> method will solve all possible problems with creating a minimap in your project: you don&#39;t need to render your scene twice as other products offer. In addition, you can make levels with any degree of illumination (including night levels) and this will not affect your minimap in any way.</p><p><br /></p><p>Preview (Youtube): <a href=\"https://youtu.be/p80TlwXmcnQ?si&#61;qqr4QpkF890uWXpR\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/p80TlwXmcnQ?si&#61;qqr4QpkF890uWXpR</a></p><p>Preview (exe): <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wnQYoTMcFtw1x0erQk-bbTYPEZgfPMf6/view?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wnQYoTMcFtw1x0erQk-bbTYPEZgfPMf6/view?usp&#61;sharing</a></p><p>Documentation (pdf): <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AA45vwikW0GEnkLfW4VLeS_cCYwboZuD/view\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AA45vwikW0GEnkLfW4VLeS_cCYwboZuD/view</a></p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/607885cfa08b4bc3aa3d625e17107354\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link to Blueprint-version of the project (supports <strong>UE4.24&#43;</strong>)</a></p><p><br /></p><p>Features:</p><ul><li>Quickly create quests, set up complex quests consisting of completing any number of different quest objectives, as well as multiple consecutive quest steps.</li><li>Includes a Minimap User Widget (<strong>texture-based minimap</strong>) with the possibility to display quest objectives.
