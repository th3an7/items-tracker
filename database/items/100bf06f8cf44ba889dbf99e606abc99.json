It provides the possibility of creating a special class of the actor, <br />the main feature of which - is the ability to hit and cause damage to targets beyond the obstacle. Thus it is possible to achieve the effect of the shooting <br />like in the world famous Counter-strike, when an obstacle does not guarantee complete safety for your opponent.. <br />Actors created on the basis of the main plugin class and its subclasses, are essentially is already &#34;bullet&#34;, and working on the principle of &#34;fire and forget&#34; - only need to specify the starting point and the direction of flight, <br />everything else the bullet will make itself, depending on its configuration. Bullet taken into account not only the thickness of the obstacles, which it got, <br />but also the physical properties of the surface of the obstacle, these properties can be adjusted depending on your preferences. <br />In addition, the bullet can produce effects for the inlet and outlet openings and transfer damage using standard methods of UE4 (like Apply Damage and etc.), <br />add impulse to the point of bullet hit - and therefore the integration of plugin will not require any serious changes in your project. <br />Thus ABulletPenetrationPlugin covers a wide range of applications, necessary to create a shooter. All in your hands!",
  "technicalDetails": "• List of Modules: ABulletPenetrationPlugin(Runtime) <br />• List of Features: <br />- ABulletPenetrationPlugin is written entirely on C&#43;&#43;, but is aimed primarily for users working on a bluprint.No C&#43;&#43; coding required, everything can be managed via blueprints. <br />- 2 Blueprint&#39;s functions for launch your bullet : StartFly and StartFlyWithOverride. <br />- 1 Blueprint&#39;s bindable event : OnBulletHit. <br />- Debug options are available in the class of bullet settings. <br />- Full control to configure effects for the inlet and outlet openings via DataTable. <br />- Can transfer damage using standard methods of UE4(like Apply Damage and etc.) <br />• Intended Platforms: Win32, Win64, HTML5 <br />• Platforms Tested: <br />- UE4 Projects(packaged) : Win32, Win64, HTML5 <br />- UE4 Editor : Win64 <br />• Documentation Included: Yes, as ToolTips in Editor <br />• Important\\Additional Notes: <br />- ABulletPenetrationPlugin already includes a binaries for Win64.Therefore it can be used in the Blueprint-only projects.\t- After the installation of ABulletPenetrationPlugin, a special class will be available, and you can create your bluprints based on which. All the default variables <br />of this class, blueprints, who was based on him, will be have detailed description and visual schematic hint,with detailed information on the appointment of the variable. <br />- The algorithm of the plugin uses a complex trace. Since in UE4 tracing of BSP-geometry may return wrong results, <br />we recommend to exclude the BSP-geometry from the level, but its availability and using will not lead to any errors of the plugin.",
