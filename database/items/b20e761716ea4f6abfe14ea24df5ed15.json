  "longDescription": "<h2><strong>5.3 UPDATE:</strong></h2><p>Metasounds are here! This update contains 8 new metasound presets using the existing sounds as well as providing a few examples of how they can be used.</p><p>These include a button with Pressed, Released, Hover, and Unhover states, a layered start-loop-stop sound, and a timing sound that gets quicker based on a paremeter.</p><p>And because these are all presets, you can easily swap out the sounds for your own sounds and they should work as intended!</p><p>If you&#39;re on Unreal Engine 5.3, then you will have access to these new features.</p><p>Check the <a href=\"https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/sound-effects-packs/123019\" rel=\"nofollow\">forum thread</a> for more details.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>UPDATE 2:: Background Music Added</strong></p><p>The background music from the audio example has been added into the project under Music. It has an intro, a loop, and a full song wave file and sound cue files.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>UPDATE:: 5 NEW SOUNDS</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve added five new sounds from an upcoming pack I&#39;m working on as well as fixed the two looping sounds so that the loop is much cleaner this time. You can find the new sounds in the EXTRAS folder.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>What is this?</strong></p><p>It&#39;s actually a combination of two sets of sound effects. One is a User Interface (UI) and item set and the other is a collection of magical effects. Both sets of sounds are sounds you would most likely hear in colorful platformers, puzzles games, or Role Playing Games, but you can of course use and combine them anyway you like.</p><p>Here are some examples of the sounds.</p><p>UI SFX</p><p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/virix/virix-uas-ui-item-sound-effect-jingles-demo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://soundcloud.com/virix/virix-uas-ui-item-sound-effect-jingles-demo</a></p><p>Magical SFX</p><p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/virix/uas-magical-sound-effects-demo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://soundcloud.com/virix/uas-magical-sound-effects-demo</a></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Support</strong></p><p>If you have any questions or are having issues with any of the included items, please visit the support thread in the forum or email me as I am able to respond to either of these much more quickly.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://forums.unrealengine.com/unreal-engine/marketplace/1590278-sound-effects-packs\" rel=\"nofollow\">Support Thread</a></p><p>Email: davidm&#64;virixcore.net</p>",
