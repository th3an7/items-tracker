  "longDescription": "<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/S3KHuq_OQ3o\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>TRAILER</strong></a></p><p>This tool aims to remove the need for expensive external packages that convert polygon models to volumes by using blueprints and materials to recreate the texture slices all within UE4 in a quick and easy manner.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is a simple and easy to use tool that can convert your 3D models into Texture Slices that can be used with a ray-marched volume material! It works by converting static meshes to texture slices - the textures themselves can then easily be exported and used in a wide variety of VFX.</p><p><br /></p><p>For best results, your models need to be single, watertight geometry and have no intersecting polys (several example models of varied complexity have been provided for guidance). Tests have been done with a human face, mech, cloud and a part of a fractal - all of these have been included as models and as final texture slices.</p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/gdL5nvnK5BA\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>&#xfeff;TUTORIAL</strong></a></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>NOTE: The Ray-Marched Volumetric Material that is used to display the results of the Mesh-To-Volume BP is based on a tutorial done by Ryan Brucks. Some further modifications have been made to make it compatible with newer engine versions (&#43;4.22). </strong></p><p><strong>It&#39;s use here is mainly for demonstration purposes of the main Blueprint Function - if that material is the main reason for your interest, please have a look at his tutorial on how to recreate a ray-marched volume material.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>For QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS get in touch on out </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DumpsterFireProductions/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>FB Page</strong></a></p>",
