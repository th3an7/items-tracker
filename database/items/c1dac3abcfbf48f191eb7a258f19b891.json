  "longDescription": "<p><strong>Hi Dev!</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>In this package you&#39;ll find sounds of shooting, reload, bursts, empty guns, and even a cannon!</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VuRof3GpPb4rLlv8WlbmNLuWS4aXMjOy/view?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Check the documentation</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/NV0xiJJ9OYI\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Check the preview</strong></a></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Abou the package</strong></p><p>It&#39;s a package with more then twenty shooting variations, and more than forty different types of reloads, some mechanical sounds that you can use for when the player picks a weapon up, or drop it on the ground.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>How the sounds were made?</strong></p><p>The reload are real! I went into a store and recorded several different weapons for you, and the blasts are from explosives in general, because the sounds of real guns shooting are pretty similar, so there&#39;s a folder with some raw shooting but the design ones with explosions are much better for gaming :)</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Layers</strong></p><p>You&#39;ll have the complete sound of the shooting, but also the layers that made that sounds, so if you want just the explosion for use it as a grenade, for example, you have it! If you want just the mechanical sounds for a lever, or something like that, you have it! And so on... You can check all the sounds in the preview/Documentation on top of this document</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Helping each other</strong></p><p>When you decide to invest here you&#39;ll make a small creator very happy and you&#39;ll get a lot of excellent sounds in return, also, I&#39;m always listening to feedback from customers on how to do better, you can check my reviews and most of them are 4/5 stars :D</p><p><br /></p>",
