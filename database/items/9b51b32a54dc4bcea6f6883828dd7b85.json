  "longDescription": "<p>Dive into the dynamic world of water with our Unreal Engine Jetski Asset Pack! This comprehensive pack includes a high-quality drivable jetski, complete with a powerful engine system, realistic sound effects, and stunning visual effects powered by Niagara.</p><p><br /></p><p>Youtube Overview: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Fagj5Ziafz4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/Fagj5Ziafz4</a></p><p><br /></p><p>The jetski itself takes center stage as the hero asset, featuring a skeleton mesh that enables the utilization of a steering wheel within the included animation blueprint. The jetski boasts a modest 12,000 triangles (12k tris) and is accompanied by a single material.</p><p>Included within this package are Base, Metallic, Normal Map, and Mask Texture options, providing flexibility for users to customize the jetski&#39;s color to their liking. Take advantage of these texture options within the material instance, allowing for seamless adjustments and ensuring that your jetski perfectly fits the aesthetic of your project.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Blueprint combines everything, from physics-based driving on Unreal&#39;s water to controlling the jetski&#39;s color. It includes engine and wind sound design, changing the color of the jetski &#43; VFX by pressing Tab. Lean in the direction of acceleration and braking, leaning left and right.</p><p><br /></p><p>Update January 7, 2024: I added a custom Jet Ski AI that follows the player&#39;s pawn. It operates without a Nav Mesh and also incorporates buoyancy. Just select a BP_Jetski in your scene and set the &#39;Jet Ski Type&#39; option to &#39;Follow Player AI&#39;.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Jet Ski was created by our talented artist: <a href=\"https://stellanjoerdens.artstation.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stellan Jordans </a></p><p><br /></p><p>Get support on Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/tdtRCRGYqs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://discord.gg/tdtRCRGYqs</a></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Important: </strong>This asset pack relies on the Epic Unreal Engine Water Plugin and is a mandatory requirement. We use this in the Showcase Map. Please activate the water plugin before adding the Jet Ski asset pack. The showcase map will not show up if you forget this!</p><p><br /></p><p>Well-optimized and utilized in the game GG-Party with a download size of 30MB and an unpacked size of 72MB.</p>",
