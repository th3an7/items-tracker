Have you asked yourself how to manage all your relative offsets easily over a hundred equipment items? How to Dual Wield? How to manage genders in equipment? How to replicate it? This is your solution!</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Key Features</h2><p>This system is very extensive, the core features are as follows:</p><ul><li>Static Mesh Equipment</li><li>Skeletal Mesh Equipment</li><li>Master Pose Component, for swapping character skeletal meshes</li><li>Dual Wield</li><li>Latent Animation Handling</li><li>Gender-specific equipment</li><li>Ammo Management</li><li>~100 equipment examples</li></ul><h2>Basic and Advanced components</h2><p>The core of this system is equipping and equipping items. But to show all capabilities of this system it also includes a lot of other systems on a basic level. These basic systems are just here to showcase how the product can be used and are not intended to be the core of this system. However, due to these basic systems, the integration is flawless with my other systems.</p><p>Don’t worry, if you do not want to use my other modular assets, it is no problem. You can use the basic integrations as an example of how to integrate into your own.</p><p>The integration examples that are included are:</p><p>·        Basic Inventory System: pick up items and perform actions on them.</p><p>·        UI Manager: handles the creation and deletion of HUD elements. A beautiful Survival Based Theme UI is used as an example.</p><p>·        Basic Equipment manager: equip tools and weapons at a socket and be able to perform an action with it.</p><p>·        Basic attribute manager: change attribute values on certain events</p><p>·        Basic combat: do damage with equipment.</p><p>·        Basic building system: place items from an inventory into the world</p><p>·        Interaction: For any interaction in the world</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Extended Movement Component</h2><p>This system includes a basic “Extended Movement Component”.

I would love to know what awesome things you are working on.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h3>Quality First</h3><p>The best and nothing less. Our core principles keep our assets the top of what’s available.</p><p>Where possible:</p><p>·        Complete and flexible, I include the most common use cases for most types of games in our products.</p><p>·        Data-Driven approach, so adapting is easy. We provide spreadsheets for mass edits.</p><p>·        Flawless integrations.</p><p>·        Blueprint only, so we keep it accessible for you and your complete team.</p><p>·        Extensive documentation, I try to comment on everything in the code. Besides that, the systems come with documentation after verification. I try to not only explain what happens by also why. I want you to be able to learn.</p><p>·        I aim for my assets to be production-ready.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h3>Example Images and content</h3><p>On the product page, I use some example images of how it can look in a populated scene. That populated scene is not included. The scene in the example area is. Check out the demo for the full experience!</p><p>Nearly everything is made by myself! However, I am also using amazing Epic Games content where I can. Also, I do make use of CC0 assets where possible. Credits are in the readme files.</p>",
