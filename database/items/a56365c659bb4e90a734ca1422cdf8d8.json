You could even turn this into a side scroller if you choose.</p><p><br /></p><p>This template contains hand keyed animations, blueprints, menu widgets, and is local multiplayer ready. You will need additional game pads (one per player) if playing local multiplayer. For testing, you can check box &#39;skip assigning gamepad to player 1 and use a keyboard/mouse for player 1, and subsequently gamepads 1-3 for players 2-4. Included are the player character blueprint, AI Base, AI Rifle (Child BPs of Player), Game Instance, A Camera Object (zooms in and out with additional players), Game Mode, No Climb volume, checkpoint blueprints, kill volume, health and weapons, and projectile to name a few.</p><p>In addition to the above, there is a cover blueprint which allows the player to go into cover when you press gamepad face button right or &#39;c&#39; on the keyboard. You can swap between fists, rifle, or melee weapons as well. There are two playable levels included in the package, a menu level which triggers the title screen and cooperative menu. There are particles that display impact and combo counts, along with gun smoke/sparks giving the illusion of barrel heat.</p><p>There are many animations hand keyed included (Combat, locomotion, death, climbing, and cover); The audio was created manually via microphone and customized to sound like punch/kick SFX. Original starter content was included in the UE4_Organic folder for organizational purposes.</p><p><a href=\"https://discord.gg/T2cbmjt\" rel=\"nofollow\"><u>Discord Server</u></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#61;PL2tM1POyiwv7QMwuylRnG8Y0M3szsKm3O\" rel=\"nofollow\"><u>Tutorials Playlist</u></a></p>",
