  "longDescription": "<p>Latches, levers, dials, switches, keys, and any other possible noise that can be made with a 60+ year old typewriter. </p><p>Sounds can be used as they are for helping to create all the sounds needed for a fully functional typewriter, or in parts for dialogue text boxes, or as simple UI elements. </p><p>These sounds can also be very useful to the sound designer as additional elements for foley, weapon noises, or any mechanical noises needed to fill out other areas of your project. Or for the very keen audio person, could even be added to a sampler (such as Kontakt) to create a fully \"playable\" typewriter. </p><p>Broken out into the following categories:</p><ul><li>Carriage and Bell</li><li>Keystrokes (Hard, Soft, and Press Down/Up Variations)</li><li>Margin Guide Slids</li><li>Paper Feed Dial</li><li>Ribbon Feed Mechanism</li><li>Switches and Latches</li><li>General Typing (Could be easily looped)</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Recorded as a stereo pair, but can be summed to mono without significant loss if saving space is required. </p><p><br></p><p>Signal Flow:</p><p>Microphones: sE T2 - Large Diaphragm Condensers (Pair)</p><p>Preamps: API Channel Strips - No EQ</p><p>Converters: Apollo 16 - Clocked to Isochrome OCX</p><p>DSP: Minimal noise reduction and limiting to provide a more natural/realistic sound</p>",
