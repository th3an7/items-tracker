  "title": "Procedural Cemetery",
  "description": "The procedural cemetery was created to provide a way to generate a full cemetery quickly. It is fully customizable and comes with several ready to use assets.",
  "longDescription": "<h2>*****</h2><h2>This procedural cemetery utilizes the 3D Text Plugin</h2><h2>*****</h2><p><br /></p><p>Video example: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/7qgdcbNrvkU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/7qgdcbNrvkU</a></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Rebuild Scene?</h2><p>When modifying the parameters, it can take a moment to rebuild the scene. If you are modifying multiple values, this rebuilding can be frustrating. By unchecking this parameter, you can avoid the rebuilds until you have made the desired changes. After making those changes, this parameter can be checked to see the results.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Layout number</h2><p>The procedural system utilizes the random stream function so that the same layout will be maintained given the desired parameters. The layout number represents the seed used for the random values used in the construction of the cemetery. There are as many variations as allowed by this value.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Fence Sections X</h2><p>This value determines the number of fence sections in the X direction. The minimum number of sections is 3.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Fence Sections Y</h2><p>This value determines the number of fence sections in the Y direction. The minimum number of sections is 3.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Gates Open?</h2><p>There are four gates in the cemetery fence. One in the center of each side. This parameter determines if those gates are open or closed. The gates open to the inside of the cemetery.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Earliest Death Year</h2><p>This parameter controls the date ranges that will be used for the lifespans displayed on each headstone. It allows for a general age of the cemetery itself. The actual date range will begin with a random value between this parameter value and the current date. This will become the year of death. Using that year of death, the year of birth will be a random date up to 120 years in the past.</p><p>Note: There is currently a tracking issue related to the date calculations (UE-135466). The target for a fix is version 5.1. Due to this issue, I am creating the date using a “brute force” method. When the issue has been corrected, I will update this Blueprint so that it uses the correct date calculations.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Headstone Data</h2><p>The headstone data consists of a list of values related to the headstones. Many of these have been included with the procedural cemetery, but more may be added and/or removed as desired. These values are as follows:</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h3>Headstone</h3><p>This is a static mesh model of the headstone that will be placed at the location of the burial plot. Several headstones are included with the procedural cemetery.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h3>Name Location</h3><p>Each static mesh model can be different and, therefore, the location of the inscriptions must be defined. The Name Location is a vector parameter which represents the X, Y, and Z coordinates relative to the headstone. This is the location at which the name will be placed.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h3>Date Location</h3><p>As with the name, each static mesh model can be different and, therefore, the location of the inscriptions must be defined. The Date Location is a vector parameter which represents the X, Y, and Z coordinates relative to the headstone. This is the location at which the lifespan dates will be placed.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h3>Epitaph Location</h3><p>As with the name and date settings, each static mesh model can be different and, therefore, the location of the inscriptions must be defined. The Epitaph Location is a vector parameter which represents the X, Y, and Z coordinates relative to the headstone. This is the location at which the epitaph will be placed.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h3>IsSingleUse?</h3><p>Some headstones are unique and would therefore only be used once in a given cemetery. By checking this parameter, the related headstone will only be used once (if at all) in the creation of the cemetery.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Headstone Materials</h2><p>Each of the headstones will be assigned a random material. Several have been included with the procedural cemetery, but more may be added and/or removed as desired.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Headstone Chance</h2><p>Most cemeteries are not full and will have empty plots available. The chances each plot being empty is controlled with this parameter (0&#61;completely empty, 100&#61;completely full).</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Single Use Chance</h2><p>As there are a limited number of single use headstones, it is desirable to spread them around the cemetery. The larger the cemetery, the less frequently they should be used. This parameter controls the chances that a single use headstone will be used (0&#61;never, 100&#61;more probable).</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Last Names</h2><p>Each of the headstones will be assigned a random last name. Several have been included with the procedural cemetery, but more may be added and/or removed as desired.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>First Names</h2><p>Each of the headstones will be assigned a random first name. Several have been included with the procedural cemetery, but more may be added and/or removed as desired.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Epitaphs</h2><p>An epitaph is an inscription on a tomb or monument in honor or memory of the dead. Each of the headstones will be assigned a random epitaph. Several have been included with the procedural cemetery, but more may be added and/or removed as desired. Note: It is best to keep these short as the font size will be determined by the length of the text.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Flowers</h2><p>The flowers are a combination of a static mesh model of a vase and several different static mesh models of flowers. They are arranged and combined into a blueprint actor. This blueprint actor will be placed at a location next to the headstone. Several flower blueprints are included with the procedural cemetery, but more may be added and/or removed as desired.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>Flowers Chance</h2><p>Most headstones are not accompanied by flowers. The chances of a headstone being accompanied by flowers is controlled with this parameter (0&#61;No flowers, 100&#61;Every headstone).</p>",
