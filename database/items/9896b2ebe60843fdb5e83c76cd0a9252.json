  "description": "An easily implementable selection of turn based battle systems similar to those found in popular RPGs. Includes four different systems for determining turn order calculation, each with different sub-systems.",
  "longDescription": "<p>Preview: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;EdT_-jP_tDo\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v&#61;EdT_-jP_tDo</a></p><p><br /></p><p>The turn-based battle systems package is the easiest way to implement turn-based battles into your project. Simply inherit from the battle participant base class and change the Game Mode and you are one function call away from initiating a battle at any time.</p><p><br /></p><p>Includes some basic attributes such as agility (required for speed based sorting), strength and defense (for simple damage calculation that can be changed to suit your game) and health. Two different example attacks are included, as well as death and victory checks. Visual and audio effects are included which can be easily replaced, and a simple turn order widget shows the order of battle.</p><p><br /></p><p>Guides:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/1whycoedg5ho2gj/Turn%20Based%20Battle%20Character%20Implementation%20Guide.pdf?dl&#61;0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Character Implementation Guide</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/30r8tgdaera2g6z/Turn%20Based%20Battle%20Skill%20Guide.pdf?dl&#61;0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skill Implementation Guide</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/24omypit0csvofu/Encounter%20Guide.pdf?dl&#61;0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Random Encounters from Third Person Template</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/vjlvleflqrnxgas/Random%20Enemies%20Guide.pdf?dl&#61;0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Random Enemy Spawns</a></p>",
  "technicalDetails": "Each system inherits from a base Game Mode class which contains essential functions, with child classes that control the different systems available:<br /><br />Simple: Turn order is determined from when participants were added to the battle. <br />Simple Team: All participants per team take their turn and team order is determined based on when each team was added to the battle.<br />Simple Preselect: Order is determined the same as Simple mode, but characters select their action first, then the turn plays out.<br /><br />Agility: Turn order is determined by the participant&#39;s agility (speed) stat, with participants with a higher stat going first.<br />Agility Preselect: Order is determined the same as Agility mode, but characters select their action first, then the turn plays out.<br /><br />Charge: Each participant has a bar that charges over time and when full, can take their turn. Includes three modes:<br />Wait: Time does not pass while in menus or while animations are playing.<br />Pause on Action: Time does not pass while animations are playing.<br />Continuous: Time never stops.<br /><br />Countdown: Each participant has a counter value, which is decreased until reaching zero, at which point they can take their turn. At the conclusion of their turn, the counter value can be set to high or low actions, delaying or speeding up their next turn.<br /><br />Intended Platform: Windows",
