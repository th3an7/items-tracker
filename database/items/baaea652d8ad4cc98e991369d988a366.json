  "longDescription": "<p>Video:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;67IZ2DikZBM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;67IZ2DikZBM</a></p><p><br /></p><p>Check the Project Build (Windows 64):</p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pgXqCOu5Ced8lpg3GJ0pIJwjAhCLMJ6E/view?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pgXqCOu5Ced8lpg3GJ0pIJwjAhCLMJ6E/view?usp&#61;sharing</a></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Breathing Audio System is a setup inside character Blueprint with mechanics for breathing sounds. It measures actor’s velocity and stamina and when stamina reaches zero, system plays breathing sounds. It starts with mild and slow sounds and gradually increases while a character is running, until it reaches its’ peak when it plays random loops of fast breathing. When character stops and regains stamina, breathing gradually slows down until it stops. Stamina exhaustion point and recover time are public variables. There are 3 different types of breathing sounds: regular, breathing through a gas mask and breathing through radio.</p><p><br /></p><p>I am using this asset in my first Indie Game: Wildlife Rescue Simulator is up on Steam. Please add it to your Wishlist: <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2797390\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2797390</a></p><p><br /></p><p>To implement it in your character Blueprint you need to copy everything from Breathing character Blueprint and paste it to your character. You need to create every variable a system needs and add 3 SoundCues as components.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you have any questions or issues don’t hesitate to contact me at: bartkamski&#64;gmail.com</p>",
