This kit has been designed to help with the iterative process by providing some of these common features for you, allowing you to spend more time developing the features that make your game unique. </p><p><br /></p><p>Many of the Blueprints contain display assets to be used as placeholders, for whiteboxing, or as final products if they fit your game&#39;s aesthetic. They have been developed to be used or replaced as needed. </p><p><br /></p><p>Take this project and build off of it, rip out the content you need, or use it all as placeholder. The Platforming Blueprints kit has been designed with one goal in mind - make platforming development easier for you. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Features: </strong></p><p>Coin Pickup</p><p>Coin Spawn Spline</p><p>Life Pickup</p><p>Lose Life/Gain Life (Player Controller)</p><p>Checkpoints</p><p>Door interact with regular key</p><p>Door interact with tagged key</p><p>Killzones</p><p>Damage Zones</p><p>Lose Health/Gain Health (Player Controller)</p><p>Teleporter (one way and two way teleporters)</p><p>Movable Platforms (on overlap and on timer)</p><p>Interactable Chests</p><p>Jump Pad</p><p>Level Switch</p><p>Ceiling Trap</p><p>Breakable Box/Item Container</p><p>Pass-Through Platforms</p><p>13 display meshes for various blueprints</p><p>2 simple to use master materials that can be applied to a number of assets</p>",
