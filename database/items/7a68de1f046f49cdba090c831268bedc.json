It contains a variety of options to allow for the creation and control of your desired actor type. The actor can be controlled via player inputs, or through the use of blueprint events from the owning actor or any other, with some example automover actors included.\tIf you are looking for a simple option to allow for a player controlled or automated train, mining cart, tram, or other type of train like actor, then this controller may be of use to you.</p><p><br /></p><p>Also included is...</p><ul><li>A camera controller, for use when having a player controlled train or anything else you may want to use it on.</li><li>A meshed track actor, that allows you to quickly create tracks for your trains, while deforming a mesh to match the resulting spline shape.</li><li>Some automovers to allow for simple automatic control over a train when it overlaps with the automover in question (such as telling it it&#39;s time to stop and open its doors, or that it needs to slow down).</li><li>Two types of track and and two cars for demonstration and testing purposes. Should you wish to use them in your own projects as well though, they do have some basic options for color and roughness on their materials and also have custom collisions where appropriate to allow for easier use in a range of situations.</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>This controller is replicated and supports multiplayer (as of last update).</p>",
