  "longDescription": "<p><strong>Please check out Sierra Division for Awesome New Art Packs! </strong>PurePolygons will no longer be creating any content.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/Sierra&#43;Division\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/Sierra&#43;Division</a></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Q: But Why??</strong></p><p><strong>A: </strong>Jacob Norris (PurePolygons) had been trying to run this venture as a side business for many years, while retaining a separate full time job. The time for creating the artwork, providing customer support, and keeping things updated was too overwhelming as a one man studio in addition to his full-time work. In 2022, with some friends, the idea for an entirely new studio was born. Sierra Division was co founded by Game and Film Industry Veterans and is the future of Top Tier Artwork available to the public. The company is dedicated to creating the highest quality artwork and providing welcoming and fast customer service. If you are looking for more PurePolygons Artwork, you can find Jacob and his teams work at Sierra Division. Thanks to everyone for the support over the years and the overwhelming positivity for the artwork. This is not goodbye!</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sierradivision.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.sierradivision.com</a></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Q: Does this mean PurePolygons is no more?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> All current PurePolygons packs will remain active and updated to the latest Unreal Engine versions, but if you are looking for new artwork and assets on the Marketplace, Jacob (PurePolygons) is now dedicating his time fully to Sierra Division and the incredible team of people creating content there. Thanks again</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Industrial Props Set</strong></p><p>Preview Video:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;86y-eFNrJj4&amp;feature&#61;youtu.be\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;86y-eFNrJj4&amp;feature&#61;youtu.be</a></p><p><br /></p><p>This pack has been meticulously hand crafted to suit any and all of your needs when it comes to commonly used Industrial Props. All textures have been created using High Poly baking techniques within maya and Zbrush to create the most realistic textures possible.</p><p><br /></p><p>There are both closed/optimized shipping containers that players cannot enter and Modular open shipping containers with LOD&#39;s. This allows content creators to very simply place pre-made closed containers anywhere in their scene for fast art populating, as well as hand placing modular pieces to precisely fit their gameplay needs.</p><p><br /></p><p>All of the shaders for both the closed and open containers have the ability to hand-pick any color of your choice and simply overide the material on the static meshes. This allows for creating hundreds of unique variations of these shipping containers so no two in your game will look alike!</p><p><br /></p><p>The same techniques are applied to all of the barrels in the scene. I have provided closed optimized barrels that can quickly and easily be placed in your scene, as well as open barrels with lids and oil fills. Barrels also have the ability to change the color at any time with the color picking materials! All with LOD&#39;s!</p><p><br /></p><p>There are also over 9 tarp static meshes that can be placed on the ground and 5 tarp static meshes that have been draped over the shipping containers to add an organic feel to all of the hard surface assets in the scene. All with LOD&#39;s.</p>",
