  "description": "This code plugin provides functions that drastically improve the quality of life during the implementation of game flow in C++ (and BP as well).",
  "longDescription": "<p>This code plugin provides features that greatly improve your quality of life when implementing game flow in C&#43;&#43; and Blueprints.</p><p>It provides features for delaying code execution and creating easy-to-use timelines and locks.</p><p>It works using lambdas or coroutines. It also has convenient Blueprint nodes for most functions.</p><p>It works very well with gameplay programming, UI programming or in any situations when there is a need to work with time and transitions.</p><p><br /></p><p>Available actions:</p><ul><li><strong>Delay </strong>- Performing a specific action after a certain period of time. This can be useful in many different situations. Every time I used the Delay node in Blueprints, I wished there was a C&#43;&#43; equivalent. There is also a BP node where time extensions or pauses can be ignored.</li><li><strong>Tickers</strong> - Tick for a specified period of time or until it is stopped or the object that owns it is destroyed. Useful for actors and components that you don&#39;t want to tick but need one ticker to do something.</li><li><strong>Wait and Execute</strong> - Waits until certain conditions are met and then executes the code.</li><li><strong>While True Execute</strong> - While the specified conditions are met ticks the given code.</li><li><strong>Run Async Then - R</strong>uns a given task function on a separate thread and calls a callback function on the game thread when that task completes.</li><li><strong>Timelines </strong>- Easily launch your timeline and update your game based on it. A great solution for all kinds of blends and transitions.</li><li><strong>Time Lock </strong>- Blocks the execution of a block of code until the specified time has elapsed.</li><li>And more...</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Each action is fully controllable and can be defined to ignore pauses, global time dilation, and more.</p><p>The plugin is designed to be easily extandable.</p><p>The plugin is free and open source. Any contribution and support is welcome.</p><p><br /></p><p>Cheers! &lt;3</p>",
