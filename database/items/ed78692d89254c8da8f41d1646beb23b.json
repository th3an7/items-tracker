  "longDescription": "<p><br /></p><p>Watch <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Pqf_Daalzbk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Demo Video</a></p><p><br /></p><p>Unreal project featuring a Question and Answer game where the characters fight hitting or getting hit depending on whether the answer chosen is correct or incorrect*.</p><p>To make it more interesting, mixed with the questions and answers there’s wrong phrases and direct attacks, to hit first without knowing the answer (dealing less damage).</p><p>*Phrases are not included to allow you to choose the topic.</p><p>The game also has a Level Counter, Level Bosses system, Combo Counter which increases the damage as the chain of correct answers grows and a “Special Attack” bar which loads with successes, allowing the player to shoot a super strong hit. Also there’s the option of limiting the time to choose the answer with a countdown, which by default turns on at a certain level.</p><p>Basic animations are also included: 3 talking, 4 fighting (punch, slap, frontal kick and lateral kick), 3 getting hit and 3 falling on floor. (The animations are chosen randomly).</p><p><br /></p><p><u>Gameplay</u></p><p>When a new game starts the main character only knows a few of the phrases, but once the enemies launch a new question or a new answer our character memorizes it and the player has that phrase available to ask or reply with them. The objective of the game is to memorize or to reason what is the correct answer (or comeback) and choose it from a list of options.</p><p><br /></p><p>The fight is represented in turns: </p><p>When it&#39;s the player&#39;s turn, he can choose between 10 options to Ask or directly Attack the enemy, some options are from a &#34;bad list&#34; which can be filled with misleading or funny phrases. If the enemy doesn&#39;t know the answer the player hits him, if the enemy knows the answer the player gets hit.</p><p>When it&#39;s the rival&#39;s turn, the CPU chooses a Question and the player must choose between 10 options, among them there&#39;s the correct answer (if the player character already has &#34;learned&#34; it) and some other options, some are wrong, some are fail phrases from the &#34;bad list&#34; and some are basic attacks to hit without knowing the answer. If the player chooses the right answer or a basic attack, he hits the enemy, if he fails he gets hit.</p><p>If the Player HP bar gets empty it&#39;s Game Over, if the player empties the enemy&#39;s HP bar he wins and runs to the next rival which has the option of launching new phrases rising the difficulty level.</p><p>Final Bosses have a greater chance of choosing the right answer.</p>",
