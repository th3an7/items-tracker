  "description": "Paul is a performant, real-time character set up in Unreal Engine 4, who comes from real scan data.",
  "longDescription": "<p><strong>Paul </strong>is a character based off real scan data, dressed in a<strong> scanned</strong>, photoreal clothing set, optimized and rigged to the standardized Epic skeleton for <strong>easy integration </strong>into the existing community pipelines.</p><p><br /></p><ul><li><strong>Showcase video</strong>: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/UUE1G3wIx8I\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;7j9jmg9oD-M</a></li><li><strong>Discord channel: </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/y783RDgxgn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://discord.gg/TvBTbBd6</a></li></ul><p><br /></p><p>The character contains a facial blendshape based rig with example mocapped animations and is derived from the very own digital human/metahuman shader pipeline from Epic games, designed to match the visual quality of other <strong>metahumans </strong>in your scene.</p><p><br /></p><p>We work hard on making our product useful for your productions, if you have any suggestions that you feel would be useful for the overall usability and scalability of our assets, do not hesitate to reach out.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>NOTE</strong> <strong>1</strong> : The character ships as a complete project with its own custom settings to ensure proper optimization and presentation for the buyer. All our characters get their shaders from one folder - if you purchase more than one of our characters, feel free to migrate it, the shaders should be plugged in as they should independently on whether you decide to overwrite anything or not during the migration process. When you do migrate to your own project, be sure that you execute the following console variable in your DefaultEngine.ini settings, otherwise grooms do not follow head animation properly.</p><p><strong>fx.Niagara.ForceLastTickGroup&#61;1</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>NOTE 2 </strong>: You might notice the groom hair shadows flickering/being somewhat lowers. To mitigate this, you can use following console variables to upscale the computation of the shadows, beware though, this, as of the current state of Unreal Engine, has a considerable impact on performance.</p><p><strong>r.HairStrands.Voxelization.Virtual.VoxelWorldSize 0.1</strong></p><p><strong>r.HairStrands.Voxelization.Raymarching.SteppingScale 1</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>NOTE 3 </strong>: The performance in the cinematic preview level is largely influenced by the <strong>lighting </strong>methods used, therefore it should not be used to judge the performing levels of the character itself for game use. For this you should use a map with conventional lighting/post process techniques.</p>",
