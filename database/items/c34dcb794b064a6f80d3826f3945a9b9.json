It contains animations, sound effects, and particles so you can be confident you are purchasing an actual game-ready asset, that can be drag-and-dropped, without requiring additional sounds or particles. The only setup required is for your character controller (&lt;5 mins).</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Drivable - Custom Skeleton and Skeletal Mesh</strong></p><p>An advanced replicated drivable demo is included. Control the doors/boot/hood, wheels, and steering wheel. The gear stick will animate as the car automatically shifts gears. Swap between interior/exterior view, to view a functional odometer &#43; RPM meter. Stationary burnouts, momentum-based tire decals, and sound effects are included, as well as satisfying engine sounds. Particles are provided for the exhaust, burnouts, and decals. The lights are fully set up with channel-packed emissive masks and configured lighting for realistic headlights (night mode), indicators, and brakes. These lights have been tested in different environments and look great out of the box.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>A fully rigged Skeletal Mesh version of the vehicle is included. It has a custom skeleton and includes bones for:</strong></p><ol><li>Each Individual Wheel</li><li>Each Individual Door</li><li>Steering Wheel</li><li>Gear Stick</li><li>Boot</li><li>Hood</li></ol><p><br /></p><p><strong>Interior and Bonuses</strong></p><p>A high detailed interior, bottom/base, and engine are included. Flat tire variations are included and tires can be removed completely with 3D suspension and axles being visible. These vehicles will look good from any angle, inside out or upside down. They are highly modular and highly detailed.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Level Designer Friendly</strong></p><p>Level designer-friendly, with extensive designer tools, allowing you to generate thousands of vehicles quickly, without having to worry about performance (editor &#43; ingame optimizations run independently). The designer tools are easy to use with event buttons, giving you complete control over the generation tools, as opposed to the construction script which runs on map load, etc.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Procedural Vehicle Generation</strong></p><p>Produce near-infinite vehicle variations with the custom BP_Interactable blueprint. It includes ~100 exposed parameters giving you complete control over a generation. Tooltips have been provided for each exposed parameter, allowing you to quickly understand what each feature provides. A full list of parameters can be seen in the .pdf documentation.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Instanced Dynamic Meshes</strong></p><p>Custom blueprint functions have been created to seamlessly swap instanced static meshes, with movable static meshes. This allows you have to thousands of vehicles while maintaining a reasonable number of draw-calls. This also allows for some parts of the vehicle to be destructible e.g. the windows, the side mirrors, windscreen wipers, and antenna. All of these dynamic meshes are cleaned up at a user-defined distance. More information can be found in the <strong>.pdf documentation. </strong>All LOD&#39;s are made by hand and each LOD screen size is adjusted for the best results.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Foliage Tools and Integration</strong></p><p>In Unreal Engine 4.25 above, the new Foliage Actor component is leveraged allowing you to paint and procedurally generate interactable vehicles into your map. This allows for rapid prototyping and can be useful for populating long stretches of highway, junkyards, etc.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Sound Effects and Particles</strong></p><p>Sound effects are included for the lootable interactions. The doors will creak and slam shut. The leaves will flutter as they fall away when you open the boot. The glass will shatter with a satisfying effect. The engine will roar and the tires will screech. Each sound is configured with basic attenuation and 3D settings for convincing results when interacting with the vehicles.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Smart Actors</strong></p><p>These actors can detect player distance, use almost no resources when idle, and clean up after themselves with a variety of optimization levels (medium and far distance). There is logic to prevent doors from opening when they shouldn&#39;t or leaves from spawning when they shouldn&#39;t. This product has gone through extensive testing to ensure no undesirable generation or clipping will occur when producing new variations. All optimizations run independently from each other allowing you to disable/enable them without concern.</p>",
