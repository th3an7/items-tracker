Additionally, variations such as robot voices and monster voices are also included.)</p><p><br /></p><h2><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/mitsugetsueight/demo_tsukaeru_ikebo_vol1?si&#61;188074909af647b8b626fa1ec1e75d67&amp;utm_source&#61;clipboard&amp;utm_medium&#61;text&amp;utm_campaign&#61;social_sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Listening Link</strong></a></h2><p>0:00~Greeting</p><p>03:40~Laughter</p><p>06:14~Battle</p><p>09:44~Count, system</p><p>11:43~Event</p><p>13:45~Daily, general purpose</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Introducing MITSUGETSU eight&#39;s Voice Assets lineup</strong></p><p>▫Lite Edition: The affordable &#34;ANIME VOICE series&#34;</p><p>▫Complete Edition: The enhanced &#34;TSUKAERU series&#34; tailored for game (English and Chinese translations supported)</p><p>----------</p><p>▿About MITSUGETSU eight</p><p><br /></p><p>The owner of MITSUGETSU eight, komiya hairu, is a Japanese voice actor, singer, composer, and engineer.</p><p>To date, we have received and produced various game voices primarily for companies in Japan, Korea, China, and other parts of Asia.</p><p>Regarding commissioned game voices, we offer a high degree of flexibility, such as recording unique spell chants specific to each work.</p><p>However, requesting voices from voice actors can often be a barrier for busy developers.</p><p>Additionally, using translation tools to create dialogue often results in unnatural language, and based on our experience, Japanese proofreading is necessary during recording.</p><p>(I know my English is sometimes unnatural too, sorry! lol)</p><p><br /></p><p>In such a context, we wanted to make Japanese anime and game culture more accessible and enjoyable for many game developers.</p><p>With this in mind, we established the brand MITSUGETSU eight.</p><p>Drawing from our own experiences, we carefully select words that are easy for game developers to use and that can be applied to various scenarios.</p><p>This is how we create our voice asset , &#34;TSUKAERU series.&#34;</p><p>&#34;TSUKAERU&#34; means &#34;usable, convenient, awesome!&#34; in Japanese.</p><p><br /></p><p>We hope that the audio materials from MITSUGETSU eight, including voice assets, songs, and BGM, can support your creative endeavors.</p><p><br /></p><p>We can also produce original game voices.</p><p>If you have any other comments or questions, please feel free to contact us!</p>",
