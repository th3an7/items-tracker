The material shows how to implement blending between near and far UVs. There are 3 texture sets included (Grass, Gravel and Rock). The landscape material is setup to use any texture set you like using the BaseColor &#43; Normal &#43; RDA (Roughness, Displacement, AO) channel structure.</p><p><br /></p><p>The textures in this pack can be used with any material. They are to be used with the landscapes painting system as alpha textures/brushes.</p>",
