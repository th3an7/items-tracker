As characters perform different actions the sounds</p><p>will be played automatically. Footsteps will adjust to character armor type. This can all be configured or disabled in blueprints.</p><p><br /></p><p>For fantasy golems we included weapons with sounds and animations such as:</p><p>dagger, sword, vampiric sword, long sword, mace, morgenstern, crossbow, bow, shield - weapons can be combined and configured in the menus - you can choose primary and secondary weapon.</p><p>Fantasy golems have 4 armor variants which can be switched in the menu</p><p>They also have 8 cape color variants which can be switched in the menu displaying in the test level.</p><p>They have 4 different head props (helmets) which can be switched in the menu</p><p>You can change character colors by overriding the RGBA value in the menu. Weapons and capes will also be affected.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you want to have a glimpse at what&#39;s included in the package watch the manual video at:</p><p>https://youtu.be/0BsiHaId9bc</p><p><br /></p><p>For more comprehensive text manual go to:</p><p>https://kornica3d.click/manuals/golem.txt</p><p><br /></p><p>If there are questions emails us at kornica3d(at)gmail(dot)com</p>",
