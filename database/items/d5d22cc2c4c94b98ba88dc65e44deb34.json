  "description": "Easily link actor events from a GUI, no scripting necessary!",
  "longDescription": "<h2>What&#39;s Mallet?</h2><p>Mallet&#39;s a nifty little level design plugin to help you speed up your workflow by allowing you to link events between actors from a GUI. Want a button to play a sound, or a trigger to activate a cutscene? No need to mess with the level blueprint, just click the two actors you want to link, select the input and output functions, type in your parameters if you have any, and hit add! You can easily add support for this system to your existing Blueprints with just a couple nodes.</p><p><br /></p><p>Mallet also comes with a bunch of premade utility actors, including advanced triggers, logic actors, and actors for spawning/moving/rotating other actors - all of which are grouped together in their own Place Actors tab.</p><h2><br /></h2><h2>DISCLAIMER!</h2><p>While Mallet&#39;s pretty neat, it&#39;s not meant as a replacement for Blueprint and isn&#39;t intended for complex scripting. It&#39;s best used alongside Blueprint for quickly linking events between actors without having to mess with the level blueprint graph. Actual scripting or coding will always be more flexible and performant.</p><p><br /></p><p>Also, <strong><u>Mallet does NOT currently work in multiplayer</u>.</strong> This may or may not change at some point. If you&#39;re working on a multiplayer project, please don&#39;t buy this plugin expecting multiplayer support any time soon!</p><p><br /></p><h2>Example Use Cases</h2><ul><li>Linking a button&#39;s Pressed event with a door&#39;s Open event</li><li>Linking a trigger&#39;s Entered event to a Level Sequence Actor&#39;s Play event</li><li>Linking the included RandomFire actor&#39;s Fired event with an AmbientSound&#39;s Play event, to play an environmental sound effect at random intervals</li></ul>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features:</p><ul><li> <strong>Easily link actor events with the Mallet IO panel. </strong>An intuitive GUI where you can simply select two actors,</li><li> <strong>Ready-to-use utility actor classes.</strong> Comes with pre-made logic tools, triggers, and other actors that integrate seamlessly with the IO panel.</li><li> <strong>Works with (some) built-in Unreal actors.</strong> Compatible with lights, static mesh actors, skeletal mesh actors, level sequence actors, and sound actors. Support for more built-in types will be added based on requests.</li><li><strong>Easy to integrate.</strong> If you want your own Blueprint classes to work with the Mallet input/output linking, it&#39;s extremely simple to set up and can be done in seconds with just a couple Blueprint nodes.</li><li><strong>Thoroughly documented (but really easy to use!). </strong>Mallet is designed to be as intuitive as possible to use, but should you get stumped on something, the documentation walks you through every step.</li><li><strong>Inspired by a certain map editor from the early &#39;00s. </strong>You know the one. If you&#39;re used to using that one like I am, Mallet brings a bunch of familiar features.</li><li><strong>Blueprint nodes for calling/listing functions in other actors by name.</strong> Mainly used internally for Mallet, but exposed so you can use them creatively however you&#39;d like!</li></ul><p>Code Modules:</p><ul><li> MalletPlugin (Runtime)</li><li> MalletEditorModule (Editor)</li></ul><p>Number of Blueprints: 13</p><p>Number of C&#43;&#43; Classes: 11</p><p>Network Replicated: <strong>No</strong></p><p>Supported Development Platforms: Win64</p><p>Supported Target Build Platforms: Win64</p><p>Documentation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10f6alv7QrarzqXD7_mwIBKH36nSNCNHoUJTlhM7GgZU/edit?usp&#61;sharing</p>",
