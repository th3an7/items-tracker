  "description": "Our fantasy medieval RPG footsteps SFX pack provides a balance of realism, flexibility, and creativity. Without the hassle of managing overwhelming number of sounds, this pack serves as an excellent foundation for both simple and advanced game projects.",
  "longDescription": "<p>Every surface in our pack features at least 5 variations for both RUNNING and WALKING actions, ensuring dynamic realism when these variations are randomized by your game engine. Additionally, we&#39;ve introduced LAYERS – Boots, Plate, Armor, and Water – that can be layered onto your default footsteps for a unique auditory experience. What sets our pack apart from others in the marketplace is its meticulous alignment. <strong>All 192 files are perfectly synced</strong>, so when two or more SFX play simultaneously, they harmonize seamlessly. This precision offers the freedom to blend diverse surfaces and layers, forging realistic and captivating footstep sounds. <em>Note that there are no walking or running loops in this pack, only single-step sound effects.</em></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>For instance, imagine your character traversing a swampy terrain:</strong></p><ol><li>Allocate the 5 variations of &#34;Grass 1 Default Footwear Walk&#34; SFX to activate randomly with each step.</li><li>Similarly, assign the 5 variations of the &#34;Water Layer&#34; SFX to play at random for every step.</li></ol><p><br /></p><p>Thanks to the flawless synchronization of our files, triggering the Grass 1 and Water Layer SFX simultaneously produces a rich auditory blend, perfectly encapsulating the feel of a swampy area.</p><p><br /></p><p><em>Tip 1: Use plate, boots, and armor layers alongside surfaces to give a special flavor to your movements, depending on which equipment your character is wearing.</em></p><p><em>Tip 2: Although volumes are matched pretty nicely as it is, playing with volume levels can help you to layer sounds more creatively. For example, if you layer grass, gravel, and armor, you can adjust the volumes for each depending on what you want to create.</em></p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cyberwave-orchestra/sets/rpg-footsteps-sfx-smart-footsteps-sound-system?si&#61;71ebf4eeb13f4be894aa13423f5e15ba&amp;utm_source&#61;clipboard&amp;utm_medium&#61;text&amp;utm_campaign&#61;social_sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">SoundCloud Preview</a> (hear interesting combinations that you can create by combining sounds)</p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/14RqfudMrbnJMAyYpA8xN655CeeF0Znql/view?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">All Files Included List</a></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><strong><u>Can&#39;t Just Walk Away?
