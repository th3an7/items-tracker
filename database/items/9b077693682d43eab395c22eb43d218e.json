  "longDescription": "<p><strong>Hello dev! </strong></p><p><br /></p><p>In this package you have access to 450 melee combat sound effects, including the mockup folder, which are the files used to create the sound effects in general. All sounds were recorded specifically for this pack, are original and of high quality.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/oH30DMTXthA\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Check the preview</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rpH2njREr8Q4e72kzQiWIRAPgoUkGmJK/view?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Check the documentation</strong></a></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Introduction.</strong></p><p>Every good combat needs sound effects to highlight the real strength of the attacks and immerse the player in the game. With this in mind, I created this package with a large number of sounds for you to use in your game, you will have a very large amount of audio to meet this need.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Usability</strong></p><p>This package comes with &#39;plug and play&#39; audios, just import them into the game and use them, without the need to cut or edit (of course you can change the pitch and other sound factors if you prefer.) The audio volumes are also relatively similar, not requiring much mixing work. Perfect for games with melee combat!</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Variety</strong></p><p>You can make sounds of various types of weapons with this pack, axes, swords, spears, medieval weapons in general made of metal/steel, and iron. There&#39;s also a folder with punches and swooshes, and another with more cinematic sounds for dramatic effects, not to mention a mockup folder, so you can create your own effects if you prefer!</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Support</strong></p><p>I am always available via documentation email to answer questions and any potential problems.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Helping each other</strong></p><p>By investing in this package you help me continue creating and also bring a number of high quality and original sounds.</p>",
