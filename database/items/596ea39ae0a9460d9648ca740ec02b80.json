  "title": "Punch and Kick - Smart Martial Arts Striking Sound Pack",
  "description": "Punch and Kick SFX pack is a smart, modular solution for layering sound effects. Create anything from standard martial arts strikes, bone-crushing punches, to magically enhanced finishing moves.",
  "longDescription": "<p>The idea behind this pack is straightforward but incredibly effective. You can easily mix our &#39;default strike&#39; sounds with your chosen &#39;layer&#39; sounds, and they will sound great together. This works because all our &#39;default&#39; and &#39;layer&#39; sounds are perfectly synchronized. You don&#39;t need to adjust their timing; they naturally fit together. Feel free to get creative with different sound combinations and optionally adjust the volume of each layer to create your desired strike sound. </p><p>We also offer a variety of swing sounds that can be helpful. We recommend triggering swings slightly before the actual strike for the best results, depending on your visuals.</p><p><br /></p><p>Check out a few examples of what you can create: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cyberwave-orchestra/sets/punch-and-kick-smart-martial-arts-striking-sound-pack?si&#61;bd208acb8c95494a9da491099e537b20&amp;utm_source&#61;clipboard&amp;utm_medium&#61;text&amp;utm_campaign&#61;social_sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">SoundCloud Preview</a></p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lL1cMeZEcol0_w8nhVqPWhZO8zwxF0_n/view?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Files Included List</a></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><strong><u>Need More For Your Fantasy Game Combat:</u></strong></p><p>Need <strong>magic spells </strong>attacks?
