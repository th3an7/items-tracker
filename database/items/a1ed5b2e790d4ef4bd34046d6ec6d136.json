  "longDescription": "<h2><strong>Links for video: </strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/GUpQjF6DSKs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/GUpQjF6DSKs</a></h2><p><br /></p><p>Improve the performance of your game at runtime by using an object pool. Creating and deleting objects requires a lot of CPU time. An object pool significantly reduces lags when spawning objects. </p><p><br /></p><p>It is precisely such lags that interrupt the flow of the game.</p><p><br /></p><p>When your project gets bigger and there are thousands of objects in a scene, the effect of an object pool is even greater. We have been using the plugin ourselves for some time and are very satisfied with the performance increase.</p><p><br /></p><p>I wrote the plugin because other object pools specialise mainly in spawning actors. With this plugin the following classes and child classes are supported:</p><p>- Actor</p><p>- Actor Component</p><p>- widget</p><p>- Dynamic Material</p><p>- UObject</p><p><br /></p><p>We did performance testing with an AMD 5800x, Geforce 3060ti, Win64. (sample project included). </p><p>Actor &#43;757 %</p><p>Widget &#43;265 %</p><p>Actor Component &#43;376 %</p><p>Dynamic Material &#43;4726 %</p><p><br /></p><p>In addition to Win64, we have also tested the plugin with UE5.01 and Android and were able to measure larger performance increases in some cases. Depending on the system and implementation, these values can be higher or lower.</p><p>It was important to me that this object pool can be integrated very easily into existing projects. It is not necessary to change the class hierarchy.</p><p><br /></p><p>The object pool is an actor component and can be easily attached (e.g. GameMode, Playercontroller, ...). </p>",
