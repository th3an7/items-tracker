  "description": "In this lecture, you learn how to import materials and lights into UE4 and how to edit them for better effect.",
  "longDescription": "<p>This lecture was given by Matthew Doyle at the Convention Center In Raleigh NC on June 6 2018 in room 305A at 1:45pm.</p><p>Materials and lights are an essential part of creating compelling, interactive content. This lecture shows you how you can simply import the very materials you already defined in your 3D application, but also how to create and edit your own materials from within Unreal. You will learn about the Unreal Material Editor, where you build Master Materials by connecting a series of nodes, and about creating Material Instances derived from that Master Material. Material Instances are lightweight and can be easily redefined using simple parameter changes. </p><p>The lecture also discusses lighting in Unreal, from the various types available to the concept of light baking. Additional features such as reflection probes and exposure settings are also discussed.</p><ul><li>PBR Materials</li><li>Master Material and Material Instances</li><li>Lighting</li><li>Reflections</li><li>Exposure Controls</li><li>Lightmass Baking Settings</li></ul>",
