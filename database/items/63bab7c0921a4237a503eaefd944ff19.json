  "description": "This showcase demonstrates how to use the Pixel Streaming plugin to stream an Unreal Engine application to web browsers on desktop and mobile devices.",
  "longDescription": "With the Pixel Streaming Plugin, you can run your Unreal Engine application on a remote computer and stream its rendered visuals and audio to modern web browsers running on any platform. Additionally, you can interact with the stream in your browser to control the Unreal Engine application remotely.\n\nPixel Streaming can broadcast your content to multiple viewers without requiring any downloads or installation. Achieve high-quality rendering that would otherwise be impossible on lightweight browsers and mobile devices using highly detailed models , complex shaders, post-processing effects, high rendering resolutions, and more. Create unique web experiences that blend the frames generated by the Unreal Engine into your own web UI.\n\nThis sample contains an Unreal Engine project that is already set up to use the Pixel Streaming Plugin, and is intended to be paired with a showcase HTML page from the Pixel Streaming infrastructure. When this project is combined with the showcase HTML, it provides viewers with additional customized controls that demonstrate sending data back and forth between the browser and the Unreal Engine application â€“ in this case, to change characters and skins. However, this functionality can easily be adapted to send any arbitrary data, thus providing a way to configure your Unreal Engine application from the browser in real time.\n\n<b>UE-Only Content</b> - Licensed for Use Only with Unreal Engine-based Products",
