  "longDescription": "<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/L35zzpg_pss\" rel=\"nofollow\">Demo YT Video</a></p><p><br /></p><p>This Player Controller is a unique take on first person control with a touch screen.</p><p>The initial design motive was to find a control method that does not involve invasive buttons overlayed on the screen. The method available here is an intuitive control scheme that allows the player to have more fluid control over camera movement and a locomotion design that allows quick movement control. </p><p><br /></p><p>To move the camera simply press and hold, then drag away from the center of the screen to turn the camera accordingly.</p><p>To move in the world just double tap in any location, if the player CAN move there it will start a transition to the point.</p><p><br /></p><p>Think google street view, but you can go any where there are solid floors. This makes this method PERFECT for acrhviz projects.</p><p><br /></p><p>A tutorial pointing you to the correct files is included in the base folder.</p><p><br /></p><p>I hope you enjoy this pack and make something awesome!</p>",
