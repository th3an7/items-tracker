Included is <strong>two different systems</strong> for handling falling damage.</p><p><br /></p><p><u>Simple Damage System:</u> Starting with a simple old-school falling damage system, which applies damage based on your fall height. This is <strong>very easy</strong> to get up and running and match with your project, <em>but is also somewhat limited in use compared to the advanced system</em> (detailed below).</p><p><br /></p><p><u>Advanced Momentum Based Damage System:</u> This system is the recommended system to use, as it takes into account changes in the player&#39;s acceleration, and calculates the amount of G forces the player would be experiencing. Then, if the G forces are above the allowable threshold, the player will receive an amount of damage based on how much they exceed it. This allows for things like cushioning falls with water volumes, jump pads that don&#39;t cause damage to the player, damaging the player when they are slammed into a wall, and much, much more.</p><p><br /></p><p>Using the advanced system included with Newtonian will result in <strong>realistic and reliable damage calculations</strong> for your players when they experience rapid deceleration, as from falling or being thrown into objects.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://orbital-market.com/product/newtonian-falling-and-momentum-damage-system\" rel=\"nofollow\">Orbital Market Link</a></p><p>(Orbital Market is a fast search engine for the Unreal marketplace)</p>",
