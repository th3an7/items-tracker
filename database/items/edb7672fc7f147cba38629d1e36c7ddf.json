  "longDescription": "<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;1kLa99dFLl0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video_Overview</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;k0sMi7Ovpts&amp;t&#61;616s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video_Quick_Start</a></p><p><br /></p><p>This UE5 pack will help you create in minutes, huge open-world grasslands. All assets are carefully optimized for enormous environments (landscapes) while maintaining a very high framerate (between 60 and 70 fps on medium computers). As you can see in the top right corner of the video, the framerate in between 50 and 70 on a 225 square km landscape with a 4k resolution real world heightmap. Actually, the framerate is higher but, because I am also recording in the same time, the framerate drops about 10 fps. Beside the high quality grass and rocks meshes, the pack comes with 4 demo levels. 3 demo levels are created with 4k real-world heightmaps from USA and Norway and the size of the levels vary from 16 square km to 225 square km. The forth level is an Overview map where you can see all the static meshes. Since everything is procedurally generated around the player by the landscape auto-material or by the Foliage Procedural Spawners, You can create even larger environments while keeping the framerate around 60 fps per second. Of course you will need to use World Partition system to keep the landscapes optimized (as you can see in the example maps from this pack) and as long as you do that, you will be able to create game ready 400 square km landscapes or even larger.</p><p><br /></p><p>The landscape auto-material comes with 12 layers so you can paint Snow, dirt, dry ground, pavement, cliffs etc. All the textures of the landscape auto-material are 4k. All the meshes in this pack are Nanite enabled.</p><p><br /></p><p>The pack contains 2 similar landscape auto-materials. Both auto-materials have the same layers but one of them is very optimized for open-worlds and can be used not only for PC games but also for consoles like PS4/PS5, Xbox etc. The second landscape auto-material is more expensive but it also looks a little more realistic. The videos from this pack are recorded with the optimized version of the auto-material so if you like this one, you will certainly like the second one which is higher quality.</p><p><br /></p><p>Attention: This product is using World Partition to keep everything optimized. When you first open the demo map, the landscape regions will not be loaded and this is why you can not see the landscape inside the editor. In order to see the landscape, you will have to go to the World Partition Tab and select all the regions after that right click on the selection and press Load Regions from Selection. You have to do this only once per project. This is how Unreal Engine works...</p><p><br /></p><p>If You want to use the pack at it&#39;s full potential, I recommend using Lumen. In order to enable Lumen (if it is not already enabled) you should go to Project Settings/Engine/Rendering and make sure you have the following setup:</p><p><br /></p><ol><li>Dynamic Global Illumination Method - LUMEN</li><li>Reflection Method - LUMEN</li><li>Shadow Map Method - Virtual Shadow Maps</li></ol><p>All the materials are highly customizable. The product is designed for huge open-world projects but can also be used for small environments. Everything is procedurally generated: landscape material, foliage, rocks etc. Everything is automated, so you can achieve similar results as the demo map, in minutes.</p><p>For very realistic results, I recommend using this pack in combination with a <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/Mathew81?count&#61;20&amp;sortBy&#61;effectiveDate&amp;sortDir&#61;DESC&amp;start&#61;40\" rel=\"nofollow\">real-world heightmap/landscape</a></p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features:</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>  The smart landscape auto-material comes with 12 layers and automatic slope variation, so you have everything you need to create a realistic grassland environment.</li><li>10 static meshes for foliage/rocks</li><li> 4 example maps: one is 16 square km and 4k heightmap resolution, one is 64 square km and 4k resolution, one is 225 square km and 4k resolution and the fourth is an Overview map where you can visualize all the static meshes</li><li>Full dynamic lighting setup (Lumen)</li><li>1 procedural foliage spawner</li><li> all foliage come with color variation which can be adjusted together with other parameters such as wind strength, intensity etc., directly from the Material Instances</li><li>Highly customizable and easy to use</li><li>Create an very optimized 225 square km or even higher grassland/meadow landscape in a few clicks</li><li>all static meshes are Nanite</li><li>all example maps have World Partition enabled</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Number of Unique Meshes: 10</p><p>Collision: Yes - automatically generated</p><p>LODs: all static meshes are Nanite so LOD&#39;s are not necessary</p><p>Number of Materials and Material Instances: 15</p><p>Number of Textures: 84 textures</p><p>Texture Resolutions: most of the textures are 4k (4096 X 4096)</p><p>Supported Development Platforms:</p><p>Windows: Yes</p><p>Mac: Not tested</p><p>Documentation: Please watch my videos from the description.</p><p>Important/Additional Notes: In order to use Procedural Foliage Spawners from this pack, you will have to go to Editor Preferences/Experimental and enable Procedural Foliage.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you like this pack, feel free to write a review and rate it.
