  "longDescription": "<p><strong>Hello Dev!</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>This pack was created thinking about sounding animations related to science fiction. In it you&#39;ll find sounds from several different scenarios, such as reloading a weapon, opening a door, errors, beeps, among many others.</p><p><br /></p><p>Some sounds have generic names like &#34;beep&#34; because you can use it in different scenarios, it can be a digital panel, the player typing a password, even an alarm, so a sound can serve you for more than one thing.</p><p><br /></p><p>This pack also has some analog sounds thinking for some time when the player runs out of &#34;energy&#34; and needs to fiddle with some buttons.</p><p><br /></p><p>With all this I believe that your player&#39;s experience will go to another level. By investing in this package you take all that and still help me to continue creating quality sound effects at a nice price. And You’ll get 5 Bonus laser sounds that you’re not paying for :D</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/NLV893HzHM8\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong><u>Check the preview</u></strong></a></p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aDoUgNCFAvKw2EQfISY7n0WNdqbCKMJv/view?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong><u>Check the documentation</u></strong></a></p><p><br /></p><p>Here&#39;s the list of folders for you, remember that each folder has more than one file, you&#39;ll get 103 files in total and more 15 bonus laser sounds.</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>Alarm_01</li><li>Beep_01</li><li>Big_Gun_01</li><li>Distant_Door_01</li><li>Door_01</li><li>Elevator_Button_01</li><li>Engine_01</li><li>Error_01</li><li>Explosion_01</li><li>Glitch_01</li><li>KeyCard_Accept_01</li><li>KeyCard_Locked_01</li><li>Malfunction_01</li><li>Recharge_01</li><li>Riser_01</li><li>Searching_01</li><li>Shut_Down_01</li><li>SoundScape_01</li><li>Switch_01</li><li>Ufo_01</li><li>Ufo_Pass_By_01</li><li>Upgrade_01</li></ul>",
