  "longDescription": "<p>The Level Streaming Kit provides a set of Actors to coordinate when Streaming Levels are Loaded and Unloaded, and give opportunities to perform other work whilst the levels are streaming.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Primary Feature</strong></p><p>A Level Streaming Coordinator with two main functions:</p><ul><li>Specifying a list of <em>Blueprint</em> Streaming Levels to load on map Startup, Pausing the game rather than Blocking it, allowing you to do other work whilst those levels are loading. For example, presenting a Loading Screen, Showing Hints, Advertisements, etc.</li><li>Handling of in-game requests to Load, Hide, Show or Unload Streaming Levels, in the sequence they are received, giving opportunities to cancel, change or do extra work whilst they are processed.</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Included in the kit is a Level Streaming &#34;Checkpoint&#34; Volume, that requests Loading / Unloading of Levels using the direction the Player enters or exits the volume. This has a similar effect to how games like Halo or Half Life handle large sub-regions of levels in their Campaigns.</p>",
