  "description": "An advanced system which includes inventory and items. Multiplayer-ready and fully customizable. Use with Blueprints or C++.",
  "longDescription": "<p>This system allows you to create complex or straightforward inventories with an easy-to-use API. The items and inventories are replicated and optimized. The items use UObjects, so they are extremely performant. Any game genre is supported, such as FPS, TPS, RPG, MMO, etc. It is always recommended to use Fast Replication, as it will make replication have better performance regardless of whether you are using this plugin. To enable, go to Project Settings and search fast replication. For now, child classes of UItemBase are not added, but it is easy to add them in blueprints or C&#43;&#43;. When creating a child class of UItemBase, be sure to override the functions as necessary, and add your own as you see fit. You may also use your own Item classes, however, you must reparent those item classes to the UItemBase class in ExInventory. You also have the option of creating a blueprint class derived from ItemBase, and simply overriding the functions to add your own logic. I will add a demo project in which you may examine how to use the inventory system to its fullest potential.</p>",
