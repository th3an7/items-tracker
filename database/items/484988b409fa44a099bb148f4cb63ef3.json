  "longDescription": "<p>Quepid is an integer based function queue manager designed inside of a blueprint. It&#39;s purpose is to execute functions as they are queued up and allow them to be cancelled along with any references they created. The duration, tick rate, and start delay of each function can be set, and animations started and ended based on the functions number.</p><p><br /></p><p>This project has 2 different versions of Quepid. One is a customized version with a few functions and animations set up, the other is a basic version that is meant to be customized or used for simple tasks. Both are player controllers, but the basic version can be switched to anything and dragged into the level. The HUD blueprint displays the next 10 functions in the queue and the next function can be cancelled by pressing a button, all functions can be cancelled by pressing a button, or hud icons can be clicked to cancel functions.</p><p><br /></p><p>Quepid does not have a user friendly interface, it&#39;s kept as light as possible, and it is important to understand arrays to use Quepid. All code is commented and the basic version is meant to be easy to understand, but some learning may be required if you do not have experience with arrays.</p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Number of Blueprints: The only files necessary for Quepid to work are the player controller, HUD queues blueprint, and both of their interfaces. The project also contains the UE4 mesh, idle, run, jump animations, these are to show functionality and are not used at all in the basic version. Cosmetic settings are mostly left at default values and the images included in the project are generic placeholders.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Mesh and animations used in the project are from unreal engine 4. All other assets were made for the project.</p><p><br /></p><p>To open the test level... start a new blank project, find Quepid in the library and add it to the project. Open the test level from inside the content browser. On unreal 4, enhanced input must be set to be used in project settings &gt; input, and the enhanced input plugin has to be enabled.</p><p><br /></p><p>Input: Inputs are configured to keyboard keys 1,2,3,Z, and X.</p><p><br /></p><p>Network Replicated: (Yes/No)no</p><p>Supported Development Platforms:</p><p>Windows: (Yes/No)yes</p><p><br /></p><p>Demo - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;XWs0DDNrlx8</p>",
