  "longDescription": "Video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHwhKzIi2jI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHwhKzIi2jI</>\nThis Multiplayer blueprint inventory system is designed to give unreal engine 4 developers an easy and customizable way to add any inventory to the game.\n\nAdding the inventory system to the game instantly allows you to create inventories, items and containers of any kind and now includes a new actionbar!\n\nInventories: \nMaximum weight can be defined easily from the defaults panel\n\nA large number of pre-made useful functions! \nSlot count is just as easy to define \nInitial items that can be added from the defaults panel. Every item added here will be automatically added to the inventory at spawn time. \nRNG System: Adding items with a probability ratio so that you can immediately create a looting system \nInventories come in several flavors: \nLimited and unlimited weight inventories. (For you backpack or home-crate needs) \nExtendable or Limited-slot inventories. (Extendable inventories are commonly seen in fps games / While limited slot is a more rpg-like approach) \nItems: \nItems can stack by defining their max stack size\n\nHave a weight that is counted as part of the system \nHave properties like name, HUD icon and more that can be easily be configured \nThe item class if of course extendable allowing the developer to easily add game specific variables (like gold, damage for weapons etc) \nContainers: \nEasily configured containers that are setup to trade with the current players inventory \nCan spawn with any inventory selected, to easily generate treasure chests! \nUMG Widgets: \nA Template HUD that can be easily modified and skinned!\n\nUMG Widget functions like drag and drop operations. \nA usable actionbar as seen in the screenshots!\n\nOf course basic examples are included and the character BP is overridden with several examples of functionality like pick-up!\n\nDon't forget! Everything is multiplayer ready!\n\nAlso all our code is well commented, and tooltips are filled with useful information!",
  "technicalDetails": "Designed for all platforms.\n\nThis system is designed using three core blueprints and three more UMG widget blueprints (which are of optional use/prototyping). The intended use is for Desktop/Console/Mobile use but should work for all platforms.",
