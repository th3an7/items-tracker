  "longDescription": "<p>Voice Assets for Corporate and Individual Game Developers and Creators♡</p><p><br /></p><p>To accommodate various scenarios and situations, we have carefully selected a wide variety of words voiced by the same voice actor.</p><p>These voice assets consist of generic lines that can be used regardless of genre or historical background</p><p><br /></p><p>All ages and adult-oriented works can also be used without credit!</p><p><br /></p><p>Introducing MITSUGETSU eight&#39;s Voice Assets lineup</p><p>▫Lite Edition: The affordable &#34;ANIME VOICE series&#34;</p><p>▫Complete Edition: The enhanced &#34;TSUKAERU series&#34; tailored for game developers(Currently supports English and Chinese translations)</p><p><br /></p><p>----------</p><p>▿About MITSUGETSU eight</p><p><br /></p><p>The owner of MITSUGETSU eight, komiya hairu, is a Japanese voice actor, singer, composer, and engineer.</p><p>To date, we have received and produced various game voices primarily for companies in Japan, Korea, China, and other parts of Asia.</p><p>Regarding commissioned game voices, we offer a high degree of flexibility, such as recording unique spell chants specific to each work.</p><p>However, requesting voices from voice actors can often be a barrier for busy developers.</p><p>Additionally, using translation tools to create dialogue often results in unnatural language, and based on our experience, Japanese proofreading is necessary during recording.</p><p>(I know my English is sometimes unnatural too, sorry! lol)</p><p><br /></p><p>In such a context, we wanted to make Japanese anime and game culture more accessible and enjoyable for many game developers.</p><p>With this in mind, we established the brand MITSUGETSU eight.</p><p>Drawing from our own experiences, we carefully select words that are easy for game developers to use and that can be applied to various scenarios.</p><p>This is how we create our voice asset , &#34;TSUKAERU series.&#34;</p><p>&#34;TSUKAERU&#34; means &#34;usable, convenient, awesome!&#34; in Japanese.</p><p><br /></p><p>We hope that the audio materials from MITSUGETSU eight, including voice assets, songs, and BGM, can support your creative endeavors.</p><p><br /></p><p>We can also produce original game voices.</p><p>If you have any other comments or questions, please feel free to contact us!</p>",
