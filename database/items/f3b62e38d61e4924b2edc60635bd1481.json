Please add it to your Wishlist: <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2797390\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2797390</a></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>All sounds are procedural it means that each sound is divided to 3 parts: start, middle and end. Each part has 3 versions played randomly. So there is 27 variations with only 9 sounds.</p><p>There are separate bullet reloading sounds for Sniper Rifle and pump bullet reloading sounds for Shotguns which you can setup after each shot.</p><p>There are also different reloading sounds for each type of weapon. There are made with single sounds like pulling out/pushing in cartridge, pulling guncock, etc. There are mixed in Sound Cues with delay nodes so you can easily set timing of the sound to your animation.</p><p>There are gun equipping sounds mixed in Sound Cue with separate fabric and gun clicking sounds to adjust timing to animation.</p><p>There is a small Blueprint setup to play casing sound where casing drops. So when you move away from dropped casing, sound stays in the the place where Casing hit the ground. Casing sounds are also procedural.</p><p><br /></p>",
