  "longDescription": "<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;Ax0pdCB8oR4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Small demonstration of video notifications</a></p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dOtPOqWaIp48kHyUNaTSYHZ97j-FpKC7/view?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Demo of how a notification is triggered 4 minutes after closing the game in one of my games. The notification is fired at 3:58 in the video.</a></p><p><br /></p><p>CmsTrillaNotifications is a plugin to launch Windows local and push notifications in multiple languages. You can launch 4 types of notifications with text and images. Launch notifications within the game wherever and however you want, when a user performs an action, for rewards, to provide information, to notify of new events, and much more.</p><p><br /></p><p>You will also have the option to launch Windows messages with different options such as information, accept conditions, open URLs and whatever you can think of!</p><p><br /></p><p>You can open Windows messages together with notifications or separately. You can launch notifications without having to also launch a Windows message. Watch the example video.</p><p><br /></p><p>The synchronization of files from your server with the user&#39;s PC is processed outside of the game so as not to interfere with the optimization of your game.</p><p><br /></p><p>Easy and without complex configurations. The plugin and the files for Windows take care of everything, you only have to configure the text, the image and decide when to launch the notification.</p><p><br /></p><p>The plugin for Ue5 is responsible for notifying the Windows scripts that I launched that notification, the Windows scripts take care of everything and outside the game thread for greater optimization.</p><p><br /></p><p>All Windows files and executables for each notification are distributed with the game build within the game folder. No external downloads, all in the same game build.</p><p><br /></p><p>Each notification.exe executable for local notifications has its own configuration files, which will be uploaded to your game and can be synchronized from your server so that the texts of each notification and image are always updated without having to upload an update. your game. The option to sync files with your server is optional for local notifications, if you do not want to activate it, the files will not be updated dynamically.</p><p><br /></p><p>We call local notifications the notifications that are launched from within the game to inform your users of whatever you want. Whether it&#39;s unlocking weapons, maps, achievements, etc.</p><p><br /></p><p>Push notifications are what you can launch outside the game to notify you of anything. These notifications are launched from the CmsTrillaNotifications Windows scripts. You will see that when you download the plugin, you will have several batch and vbs scripts. These scripts are responsible for updating the content for push notifications, creating a Windows task to check your server for new push notifications, configuring a Windows task to run push notifications when the user turns on their computer, and to configure everything necessary for notifications.</p><p><br /></p><p>Neither you nor your users will have to configure anything in the Windows registry or configure tasks, since CmsTrillaNotifications takes care of everything for you. Fast and easy.</p><p><br /></p><p>The CmsTrillaNotifications scripts will also work outside the default game installation folder from the Epic Games launcher. That is, no matter where the game is installed, the system will work outside of the default Epic Games installation folder.</p><p><br /></p><p>All push notifications are sent when the game is closed. You can set the sending delay, such as the query period to the server to send push notifications. Right now it is set to one push notification per day, but you can change the interval in your server&#39;s notification query script. Local notifications are not limited to one per day, they will be sent when the game sends them.</p><p><br /></p><p>Please note that the system only shows notifications when the player closes the game, as notifications are not shown in full screen and this way we always notify the player about important things outside the game.</p><p><br /></p><p>You will be able to access help content, examples and much more, from the links that I have left within the comments and texts within the plugin.</p>",
