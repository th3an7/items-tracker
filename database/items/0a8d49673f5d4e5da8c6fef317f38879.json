  "description": "A variety of 10 different rocks types photographed in studio and constructed using photogrammetry, perfect for Game Development and Architectural Visualization.",
  "longDescription": "<p>All assets were photographed under controlled studio lighting in order to avoid any baked in lighting in the textures. Next they were processed using Agisoft photoscan, texture/normal/AO/Roughness maps created in Substance Designer 6 and then LOD 0 was exported around 2500 polys and LOD built in engine.</p><p>All materials have detail normal/AO maps that can be adjusted or disabled, so depending on your need you can use the textures at full 4k res or smaller sizes with detail textures.</p><p>These rock assets are setup as a static mesh with collisions build in engine and can be scaled as any mesh to be used as a small rock to a bolder or large rock outcropping. They will complement any outdoor terrain or act as a decorative accent pieces in both game development and architectural visualization.</p>",
