The material instance controls the player color, if the tower should look new or used, offers the ability to add in a damaged look and adjust the roughness for a wet look.</p><p><br /></p><p>All of this offers you a all-in-one solution where you can start to visually upgrade your own RTS / Tower Defense game with this versatile artwork pack. All objects are separated static mesheswith the pivot points in the most useful and logical places in order to be later on assembled by your blueprint or game code into functioning units.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is an artwork package with a bit of logic for the material instances, but I am sure you can find a blueprint pack here in the marketplace to combine this artwork with.</p>",
