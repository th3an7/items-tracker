  "longDescription": "<p>This audio library contains the sounds of an old used Belorussian bicycle.</p><p>The sound recordings have 2 channels: chain wheel, rear wheel and additional sounds.</p><p><br /></p><p>It always seemed that every bike had a different sound. One of my friend’s bikes was particularly interesting and older, so I decided that I would definitely record its sound. I hope that as time permits I will be able to make more such sound effect collections, because it was very interesting.</p><p><br /></p><p>This sound effect collection is ideal for use in game software, applications, commercials, movies, TV shows,</p><p>videos, animation, and any other entertainment industry where a high-quality audio effect is essential.</p>",
