This is an immersive collection of 13 space and sci-fi themed music tracks. These tracks were produced and composed to incorporate <strong>different styles</strong> to fit a wide array of emotions associated with the theme of space, from obscure loneliness of the most distant planets to the joys of discovering a new home.</p><p>Each track was made to loop seamlessly to eliminate the burden of having to use audio middleware and for the developers to easily implement the music into their game/ projects. Some tracks also contain alternate versions so that the same track may be used in different circumstances of the game.</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>13 High Quality Tracks</li><li>52 WAV files</li><li>Different Edits for easy implementation</li><li>Different styles for different gameplays</li></ul><p><br /></p><p><strong>About the music</strong></p><p>I produced the music using both hardware and software, designing sounds that would fit with the overall theme. Whether it is sci-fi pulsating rhythms or vast ambient drones, this pack explores different musical moods and emotions to fit different styles of gameplay.</p><p>A short user manual has been compiled which contains information about each piece including description, suitable uses, and musical information.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>What does the future hold?</strong></p><p>I plan to release more space and sci-fi related music packs that focus on one specific style so that more music can be incorporated into the same game.</p><p>I would also readily accept community suggestions so I can include them in my next music pack.</p><p><br /></p><p>For inquiries and suggestions email: <a href=\"mailto:daniel.sinagra&#64;hotmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">daniel.sinagra&#64;hotmail.com</a></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>",
