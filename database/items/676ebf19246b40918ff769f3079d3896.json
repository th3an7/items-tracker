  "longDescription": "<p>This package contains a sea shore scene constructed using photogrammetry-based rocks and cliffs. Inspired by the Modular Cliffs package created by CGMontreal, we formed a two-people photogrammetry team and went to Qingdao, which is a beautiful seaside city located in Shandong province, China. All the rocks and cliffs in the package are photo-scanned and delighted carefully following a workflow similar to the one introduced by the Epic Games photogrammetry blog article. While we are new to the technique, we will be keep improving our photogrammetry techniques. We hope that the rock assets can help you create realistic and stylized outdoor natural environments.</p><p><br /></p><p>Please note that some of the terrain detail textures are created by CGMontreal. We appreciate his help on building this package. Here is a link to the original Modular Cliffs package from which we learned a lot:</p><p>https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/modular-cliffs</p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>All the assets come with 4k PBR-calibrated textures. However, to comply with the default texture streaming budget, most of albedo and normal maps are LOD-biased to 2k and 1k resolution. The roughness, height and AO maps are packed together and LOD-biased to 512x512 resolution.</p><p><br /></p><p>Features:</p><ul><li>PBR Materials: Yes</li><li>Photogrammetry-based Assets: Yes</li><li>Lightmass Static GI lighting: Yes</li></ul><p>Texture Sizes:</p><ul><li>(18) sets of 4k textures for all the rocks and cliffs</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Texture Size : (18) sets of 4k textures for all the rocks and cliffs</p><p>Collision: Yes, automatically generated</p><p>Vertex Count: Around 4k to 10k triangles for most of LOD level 0 meshes</p><p>LODs: Four LOD levels auto-generated by the engine</p><p>Number of Meshes: 18</p><p>Number of Materials and Material Instances: 19</p><p>Number of Textures: 54</p><p>Supported Development Platforms: Windows, Mac, HTC Vive, Oculus</p><p>Supported Target Build Platforms: Windows, Mac, HTC Vive, Oculus</p><p>Documentation:</p><p>Important/Additional Notes:</p>",
