  "longDescription": "<p>Video preview: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/EsS7k5NnIxA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/EsS7k5NnIxA</a></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>We all know that creak sound effects are powerful creators of mood and ambience, and above all help tell a story. Introducing a bold new take on Wood and Metal Creak SFX that will help you bring your project to the next level.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>As sound enthusiasts, we were keen to bring something new to the table for this category of sound...and so a novel recording approach was created to produce the sounds for this library. Due to the incredibly subtle (and not so subtle!) audio details embedded in creak sounds, a recording environment is required with particularly effective sound isolation. At the same time, a high level of control over the variety of surface type and performances of the creaks themselves is needed. Our MacGyver recording engineer Phil found a solution that produced a setup within which we had isolation, control, and variety... the &#34;Creak Box&#34;.</p><p>The Creak Box (it&#39;s a secret) is able to capture the most detailed essence of most resonant surface types, and has multiple stages of tension with which the performer of the creaks can play with. Happy with the source sounds that were being created - which is always the most important stage from beginning to end - we found that a multi mic rig was needed. To really get the depth and detail of these creaks we found that the best results were achieved by using a spatially tweaked-up microphone setup using the contact mic LOM Geophon, a pair of cardioid Sennheiser Mkh8040s, and a shotgun Rode NTG3. The best recordings always come from testing multiple mic positions, and experimenting with input levels and mic positions; this sound library brings you only our best takes.</p><p>As sound designers, we always need new, better, varied material. We want to feel excited by and connected to the sounds we use - enjoy and make it yours!</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Wood: Old wood stairs, doors, floors, ships, houses, twisting and bending wood, chairs, tables, fences, and more.</strong></p><p><strong>Metal: Big and small doors, small squeaks, huge resonant duct and convector surfaces, chairs, benches, wires, bedsprings, and more.</strong></p>",
