  "description": "SOW2 is a medieval RPG weapon and armor Inventory SFX pack. Great for Pick-Up, Equip, Drop, Loot, Collecting, Trading, and other item handling sounds. Includes a bonus of 10 sound effects from our SOW1: Medieval Blades pack!",
  "longDescription": "<p><strong>&#39;Sounds Of War 2&#39; </strong>is the second in a series of pro-designed RPG combat sound packs. It&#39;s aimed mostly at the inventory movements like equipping, dropping, and crafting of weapons and armor. Additionally, some sounds like for example &#39;Sword Draw&#39; SFX can be used when your character takes out an already equipped weapon from its container. <em>Perfect for medieval RPG games, hack and slash, JRPG, or basically any game that requires great weapon and armor inventory sounds.</em></p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cyberwave-orchestra/sounds-of-war-2-weapons-armor-inventory-sfx?si&#61;2a380584fd794134a3e2e367d37fc056&amp;utm_source&#61;clipboard&amp;utm_medium&#61;text&amp;utm_campaign&#61;social_sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">SoundCloud Preview</a></p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wLhtyztkxOQJ4DrxtEH9XX8NCQV75AAX/view?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">All files list</a></p><p><br /></p><ul><li><strong>THE CREATION</strong></li></ul><p>It took a lot of recording, mixing, and polishing to create this pack. Cyberwave Orchestra always does quality over quantity, while keeping the prices affordable. We encourage developers to talk to us about their projects because there is no greater joy in this work field for us composers than to hear our sounds in your games! :D</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>* The names we used are just guidelines and not a set of rules. You can use the sound of Axe Equip for your Mace Equip if it sounds and feels right for your project! A nice selection of &#39;all purpose&#39; and &#39;unspecified&#39; sound effects are available, which haven&#39;t been named on purpose, in order to offer you more creative freedom.</p><p><br /></p><p>Check out our pack <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/62d1096cb59944c1b14a300663724cf9\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sounds Of War 1: Medieval Blades</a> too!</p>",
