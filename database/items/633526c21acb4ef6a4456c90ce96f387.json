  "longDescription": "<p>I would like to introduce you to the Simple Instanced Spline Mesh plugin.</p><p><br /></p><p>The plugin provides a simple, lightweight, and robust tool for building Hierarchical Instanced of Static Meshes using splines.</p><p>It was built with level design in mind, to make designers&#39; life easier, and iterations faster.</p><p>It offers a variety of tools related to meshes placed using spline.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://furious-production-ltd.github.io/Plugins-Releases/SISM.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Plugin Releases</a></p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;J1WYDfHUjno\" rel=\"nofollow\">HOW TO INSTALL UE PLUGIN</a>(For Newbies)</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;FIgxPlm1K1w\" rel=\"nofollow\">OVERVIEW VIDEO</a></p><p><br /></p><p>I am happy to see what you&#39;ve made with this.

  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features:</p><ul><li><strong>Multiple meshes</strong> - you can set multiple different meshes that will automatically align on the spline. The meshes are aligned using their bounds, not the pivot, which means that if you have a mesh, that has some bad pivot, the tool will still align it in a smart way!</li><li><strong>First and Last meshes</strong> - you can set up special meshes at the beginning or end of the spline, which allows you to control exactly how your fences or walls begin or end.</li><li><strong>Mesh randomizing</strong> - with multiple meshes selected, you can make them appear randomly so that your fences, walls, or even towns are extremely simple to randomize to make them look more natural.</li><li><strong>Ground alignment</strong> - the tool allows aligning meshes to the ground using their bounds, which is much more accurate and good-looking than using pivot casting. Also, the ground alignment can be applied to each mesh individually.</li><li><strong>Asynchronous calculations</strong> - calculations are by default performed on a separate thread, which allows creating very, very long splines with thousands of meshes without freezing your computer, which improves the level design speed and makes it more comfortable.</li></ul><p>Code Modules:</p><ul><li>Â SimpleInstancedSplineMesh</li></ul><p>Number of Blueprints: 1</p><p>Number of C&#43;&#43; Classes: 6</p><p>Network Replicated: No</p><p>Supported Development Platforms: Windows 64</p><p>Supported Target Build Platforms: Windows 64</p><p>Documentation: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KDk1w7zFidcIp8mAAXHZ5BtN58ddKFUc/view?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">DOCUMENTATION</a></p><p>Important/Additional Notes: Currently ground alignment work for Landscape only, but it&#39;s a work in progress, and we are planning on adding support alignment to other surfaces too.</p>",
