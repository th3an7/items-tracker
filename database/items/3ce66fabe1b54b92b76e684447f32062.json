  "longDescription": "<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;qYqki-IgB6Q&amp;t&#61;29s\" rel=\"nofollow\">TRAILER</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;Ud1iXFIsPmk\" rel=\"nofollow\">QUICK START VIDEO</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;onbhQ_qKTH4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open World Template &#43; Landscape Procedural Ecosystem Vol. 3</a> (this video shows you what you can achieve if you combine this pack with <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/landscape-procedural-ecosystem-seasons-vol-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Landscape Procedural Ecosystem Vol.3</a>)</p><p><br /></p><p>This pack can be seen as a template or starter for a modern open world game. Combining day-night cycle and dynamic weather system, it can be seen as a &#34;must have&#34; for every open world project. If you are developing an open world shooter, survival, racing or even RTS, this pack can help you save weeks or maybe months of work. It comes with many options to customize more than 100 parameters from the Unreal Engine 5 lighting system, Sky Atmosphere, Exponential Height Fog, Volumetric Clouds, particle effects (rain, snow, fog), sounds etc. The day-night cycle shows the exact (accurate) position of the sun on the sky, depending on many parameters (which can be editable by the user) like: latitude, longitude, time zone, month and day of the year, etc. Beside this, the pack comes with 6 real world heightmaps created from real world data (Digital Elevation Models with 1 or 2 meters precision) from different parts of the planet (USA, Scotland, Russia, Norway, Island etc.). To help you create a realistic open world, the pack comes with 6 demo levels, each one containing an 8k real-world landscape, at least 64 square km each.</p><p><br /></p><p>The pack is specially created for Unreal Engine 5 Sky &amp; Atmosphere (so it doesn&#39;t use the old Sky Sphere system) and comes with 13 weather presets (Clear Sky, Cloudy, Medium Rain, Heavy Rain, Thunderstorm, Foggy, Alien Sky etc.) Because of these presets and its ingenious design, all you have to do is to drag and drop 1 single Blueprint into your map and you instantly have day-night cycle and dynamic weather. The good news is that you can create your own weather presets by tweaking more than 100 parameters (from a single blueprint, you will be able to change most of the Unreal Engine 5 parameters related to scene appearance). From the same blueprint, you will be able to access even the scalar or vector parameters of the volumetric clouds or the stars without having to modify those parameters from the material instances. You will be able to add stars to the night sky and you can choose any of the 11 stars textures you can find inside this pack.</p><p>The dynamic weather system starts with a weather preset (but it can also start with with the default lighting if no preset is active) and than, at random periods lerps between the current weather preset and a random weather preset from the presets list. You can customize which presets will be used with the weather system and you can also customize transition period or the time between transitions. You can anytime deactivate both day-night cycle and dynamic weather system, in case you work on projects which do not need those features.</p><p><br /></p><p>The blueprint comes with no preset active, so when you start a new level, after you drag and drop the blueprint inside the level, you will see the default settings. As soon as you activate one of the presets, the default settings will be replaced with the newly activated preset.</p><p>For every weather scenario (or preset) you can add appropriate particle effects and sound effects (you can choose from a list containing different types of rain, show, fog). In some cases, the particle effects can be customized directly from the blueprint (for example you can change the fog and snow color and transparency)</p><p><br /></p><p>Important:</p><p>Only one preset can be active at a time. If you have more than one active presets, the first one from the list will be taken into consideration and the next ones will be ignored. Also, If there is no active preset and the dynamic weather is active, the dynamic weather will start with the default settings and after that will continue with the presets (as long as there are presets included in the dynamic weather system). The blueprint contains 2 types of parameters: marked as &#34;GENERAL&#34; and marked as &#34;LOCAL&#34;. The general parameters can not be adjusted from the inside the presets because they do not define a weather type but they define characteristics of the entire system (for example, the &#34;Day-night cycle length&#34; or the &#34;Current date&#34; are general parameters while &#34;Sun Intensity&#34; or &#34;Moon Temperature&#34; are local parameters which can be modified from the inside of any preset. All the local parameters can also be modified from the outside of the presets system and in this case they affect the default setup (so the default setup can also be modified and this is useful when you do not need dynamic weather ). This will come as a full project. Of course, parts of the pack can be migrated into different projects but if you do that, they might need modifications. At the moment, the project uses the first person template but it can be modified into any possible type of gameplay.</p><p><br /></p><p>Using the 6 real-world heightmaps into another project</p><p> </p><p>If you want to use the real world heightmaps from my Demo levels into another project, all you have to do is to enter each of my demo levels, select &#34;landscape mode&#34; and right click on the heightmap field and press the button EXPORT. This way you can export all 6 heightmaps in less than a minute to your hard drive and after that you can reimport them into any other project. If you want to preserve the real-world scale, when you import your heightmap into a new project, all you have to do is to check my original map, in the world outliner, click on the Landscape and there you can see the scale I used for the landscape. So use the same X,Y,Z scales I used when you import the exported heightmap and you will have a perfect copy of my real world heightmap, so a perfect copy of my landscape. </p><p><br /></p><p>If you like this pack, feel free to write a review and rate it. This will keep me motivated to create better and better assets. Thank you!</p>",
