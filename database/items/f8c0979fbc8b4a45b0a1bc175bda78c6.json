  "longDescription": "<p>ForceSeatMI is a programming interface that allows to add a motion platform support to basically any application or a game. The ForceSeatMI does not control hardware directly – it sends all data to ForceSeatPM. This approach delegates responsibility of transforming telemetry data to a real motion from the application to ForceSeatPM. It means that application developers do not have to worry about things like platform disconnections, transmission errors, thermal protection warnings or signal filtering. With the latest version of the ForceSeatMI it is possible to control the hardware with usage of Inverse Kinematics. The SIM sends required top frame position and ForceSeatPM calculates required arms (or actuators) positions. This feature can be used in application where precise positioning is required instead of forces simulation.</p>",
