This is the system for you! Supercharge your project by months by using this module.</p><p><br /></p><h2>Key Features</h2><p>This system is very extensive, the core features are as follows:</p><ul><li>Growing in stages</li><li>Regrow options</li><li>Harvest options</li><li>Pluckable Yield VS direct harvest</li><li>Crop Quality calculation</li><li>Durability options</li><li>Decay and dead crops</li><li>Advanced Growing and Regrowing Requirements</li><li>Season requirements</li><li>Data Table Driven including Excel import logic</li><li>UV lamps</li><li>Sprinkler system</li><li>Includes connection to an example inventory, equipment manager, interaction system and building system.</li></ul><h1>Plant Types:</h1><p>I&#39;ve created several plant types which can be re-used for different types of crops. The Plant types are (not all crops included):</p><ul><li>Bush (For crops like: Tomato, Strawberry, Berries, Cranberries, Pepper, Eggplant, Lychee)</li><li>Dense Leaved Heads (For crops like: Cabbage, Cauliflower, Kale)</li><li>Flowering Head (For crops like: Artichoke, Pineapple, Broccoli)</li><li>Long (For crops like: Corn, Sunflower, Wheat, Rice, Fiber)</li><li>Stake (For crops like: Green Beans, Coffee Beans, Hops, Grapes)</li><li>Tree (For crops like: Bananas, Apple, Pear, Mango, Peach, Pomegranate, Mango, Orange)</li><li>Underground (For crops like: Carrot, Garlic, Parsnip, Potato, Rhubarb, Radish, Beet, Choy, Yam)</li><li>Vine (For crops like: Pumpkin, Watermelon )</li></ul><h1>Crops Included:</h1><ul><li>Potato</li><li>Beet</li><li>Pumpkin</li><li>Watermelon</li><li>Cabbage</li><li>Cauliflower</li><li>Tomato</li><li>Strawberry</li><li>Blackberry</li><li>Redberry</li><li>Lemon</li><li>Lime</li><li>Lychee</li><li>Kiwi</li><li>Bellpepper</li><li>Avocado</li><li>Green Beans</li><li>White Grapes</li><li>Purple Grapes</li><li>Pineapple</li><li>Broccoli</li><li>Corn</li><li>Banana</li><li>Orange</li><li>Peach</li><li>Pear</li><li>Apple</li><li>Pomegranate</li></ul><h2>Basic and Advanced components</h2><p>The core of this system is placing, managing, and harvesting crops. But to show all capabilities of this system it also includes a lot of other systems on a basic level. These basic systems are just here to showcase how the product can be used and are not intended to be the core of this system. However, due to these basic systems, the integration is flawless with my other systems.</p><p>Don’t worry, if you do not want to use my other modular assets, it is no problem. You can use the basic integrations as an example of how to integrate into your own.</p><p>The integration examples that are included are:</p><p>·        Basic Inventory System: pick up items and perform actions on them.</p><p>·        UI Manager: handles the creation and deletion of HUD elements. A beautiful Survival Based Theme UI is used as an example.</p><p>·        Basic Equipment manager: equip tools and weapons at a socket and be able to perform an action with it.</p><p>·        Basic building system: place items from an inventory into the world</p><p>·        Interaction: For any interaction in the world</p><p><br /></p><h2>Extended Movement Component</h2><p>This system includes a basic “Extended Movement Component”. It is capable of</p><p>·        Handles player inputs via the Enhanced Input System. It uses input mapping and I have included an advanced method for handling and dynamically linking and unlinking mapping contexts.</p><p>·        Provides a central place for the replication of montages, particle effects, spawning actors, and sounds.</p><p>·        Is full of useful functions related to your character: Switch Global orientation between strafing and forward-facing character, Define Gender, get active camera component, and more</p><p>·        Manages the camera of the player. It includes: zooming, switching between shoulder cameras, and basic first-person view</p><p><br /></p><h2>About Hyper</h2><p>Hyper is empowering virtual world builders like yourself. Eric Ruts is running it and is the creator of all assets.</p><p>I would like you to focus on the creative side of your project, and I want to provide you with the building blocks to kickstart your dream. I have spent years of work on the assets I have made available and you are able to leverage that knowledge and work on your project! Please feel free to share your projects in Discord or via mail! I would love to know what awesome things you are working on.</p><p><br /></p><h3>Quality First</h3><p>The best and nothing less. Our core principles keep our assets the top of what’s available.</p><p>Where possible:</p><p>·        Complete and flexible, I include the most common use cases for most types of games in our products.</p><p>·        Data-Driven approach, so adapting is easy. We provide spreadsheets for mass edits.</p><p>·        Flawless integrations.</p><p>·        Blueprint only, so we keep it accessible for you and your complete team.</p><p>·        Extensive documentation, I try to comment on everything in the code. Besides that, the systems come with documentation after verification. I try to not only explain what happens by also why. I want you to be able to learn.</p><p>·        I aim for my assets to be production-ready.</p><p><br /></p><h3>Example Images and content</h3><p>On the product page, I use some example images of how it can look in a populated scene. That populated scene is not included. The scene in the example area is. Check out the demo for the full experience!</p><p>Nearly everything is made by myself!
