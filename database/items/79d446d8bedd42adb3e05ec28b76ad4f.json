  "description": "A system for dialog and story scenes.",
  "longDescription": "<p>SceneText is a system for story scenes with text. It is intended for the classic style of game dialog but could be used many ways and modified to suit many tasks. It can have choices that the user clicks and other branching possibilities. It includes organized Blueprints and c&#43;&#43; classes. Story data is loaded from a JSON file or C&#43;&#43;.</p><p>Each bit of text from the file is a &#34;Screen&#34; object. A screen can do things to play out a scene like show an animation or play a sound. It can also contain a question or choice the user has to complete, and then perform an action like going to another part of the story.</p><p>SceneText can be inserted into a game as a GameMode. Once your story scene is done it can load a level and return to the gameplay. This is shown in the example, it will go to the Unreal top down mode at the end. To go through the example just load and play the template project. Examining the example project will show you how all the features work like user choices.</p><p>SceneText can be a foundation for many types of game features. Custom features would not be difficult to add in code/Blueprints. No effects are included but camera shakes and flashes would be easy to implement.</p><p>Source is included. Example project recommended.</p>",
