So you can discharge the matrix of blocks, which makes it possible to cover even very long distances.</p><p>&#43; Fixed a problem with the rotation of the LootGeneratorPlace actor</p><p><strong>Update 1.1.2</strong></p><p>&#43; Added the ability to change the offset for spawn. This is suitable if the pivot mesh is not in the center.</p><p><strong>Update 1.1.1 hotfix</strong> - fix material links.</p><p><strong>Update 1.1</strong></p><p>&#43;add support child actor Spawner. </p><p>Now you can add a spawner to your actor. For example, you can make a closet or refrigerator in advance and just place them on the level.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is a great tool to completely solve all the issues with spawning loot. You can manually adjust the size of the spawner, all the loot from the list will calculate the size and will spawn only those objects whose size is suitable for a given point. Items will no longer spawn through textures. You can make as many loot lists as you like. Adjust the respawn time, the chance to spawn and the time to remove the object. The system itself tracks whether the loot has been taken in order to start counting the time until respawn. There is a tool for spawning loot from the NPC. Tool for spawning loot on huge territories. Tool for setting global zones - you specify a specific territory and loot lists and your spawners and NPCs will spawn loot from these lists. A powerful optimization algorithm is used - there is no difference between 100 items of loot or 100,000. This system is suitable for any project. The greater the amount of loot in your project, the greater the performance benefit.</p><p>Let&#39;s say you have an open world game and you want to scatter loot around the map. Let&#39;s say you need a lot of loot, such as first aid kits, nails, weapons, weapon mods, tools, clothing, ammo, mushrooms, bushes with berries, and so on. How much could you scatter on the map without all this overloading your computer? 200 items? Maybe 500 items? And if you want prey to spawn with a chance, and even from certain lists, for example, in the mountains you have weapons of the first grade, and on the plains of the third grade. And if you want all this to be tracked and if the loot was taken, then after a while it is revived (random from the list for this place). How much booty will you put into your big world? Maybe 1000 items? And if you added a new loot during development and wanted to add it to the spawn list in two clicks and only on the coast. Maybe 2,000 items? And all this should work on the network and be calculated on the server side. But what about list-based loot for NPCs and their habitat? Maybe 3000 items?</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Do you want over 2 million items and 120&#43; frames per second?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Basic features:</p><ol><li>Over 2 MILLION loot points without losing FPS.</li><li>Work with World Composition with World Origin Rebasing</li><li>Multiplayer support.</li><li>All calculations take place on the server-side.</li><li>A new algorithm is used, it doesn&#39;t matter if you have 100 loot items or 100,000 loot items.</li><li>If you decide to add a new weapon or armor to the spawn for your world, for example, you can now do it in 2 clicks.</li><li>The code is written in C&#43;&#43; to improve performance.
