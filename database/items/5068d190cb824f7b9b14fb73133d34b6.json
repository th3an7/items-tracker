  "description": "We present a fully dynamic Day/Night system. Use any Sun/Moon texture!",
  "longDescription": "<p><strong>This is a post process material and <u>not a sky sphere material</u>.</strong> That said, it can function along with a sky sphere by changing the UseSkyColor Bool, and it will appear behind the rendered elements.</p><p>See it in action: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;ZnVRkATzsC4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;ZnVRkATzsC4</a></p><p><br /></p><p>This is a fully dynamic and ready to use solution for a sky and day/night cycle. Included is an example time of day blueprint that progresses the sun and moon around the scene. Clouds are rendered in a semi-volumetric fashion if you travel fast across the map you can see the clouds retain their position and form anew.</p><p><br /></p><p>The material takes the primary directional light and renders your texture over its source in the sky. This is a post process material so no actual geometry is involved and it can be rendered over existing skyspheres (disable UseSkyColor) Clouds are rendered over the sun and moon, and are slightly affected by their brightness. Stars come out at night. This is a base to build off of providing your own textures and methods. The time of day bp advances the sun and moon on separate paths across the sky and determines when it&#39;s night time.</p><p><br /></p><p>Many looks are attainable by changing settings and textures. Try disabling SkyColor and combine it with fog or a cubemap.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Performance: near 60fps on Intel HD 3000 graphics (old 2011 laptop) </strong></p><p><strong>Instruction count: 600-700 (high because of noise nodes, reduce levels or use textures to lower)</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>If anyone has version requests or issues please<strong> Email us at Vyrulentstudios&#64;gmail.com</strong></p>",
