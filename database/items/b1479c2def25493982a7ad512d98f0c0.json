  "longDescription": "Video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TBK3SV9H6OQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/TBK3SV9H6OQ</a><br />Preview: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/unreal-music-maketplace/adaptive-game-music-1-unreal-marketplace\" rel=\"nofollow\">soundcloud.com/unreal-music-maketplace/adaptive-game-music-1-unreal-marketplace</a><br /><br />This asset includes several seamless and synchronized loops (wav format, 100 bpm), representing 4 games states:<br />1) Background (no bass / drum, only &#34;ambient&#34;) <br />2) State 1 (bass&#43;drums) <br />3) Melody 1 <br />4) Melody 2<br /><br />You can easily crossfade between states, depending on what is happening during your gameplay. I did not have any particular game in mind, but I feel the style of music is quite &#34;dark&#34; and could work with platforms, puzzle, scrollers, casual games, etc.<br /><br />There are are also 3 &#34;end&#34; clips:<br />1: End - single hit.wav <br />2: End - standard.wav <br />3: End - dissonant.wav<br />that can be used as finisher (game over, succes, death, etc).<br /><br />The music can switch to another feel/mood such as near end level / boss / near death / hurry up /etc. There are 2 &#34;transposed melodies&#34; that can be used for this purpose. The transposed melodies connect to the standard loops via two &#34;breaks&#34; clips.<br /><br />The asset contains a doc file that explain how the loops should be used. Of course they can also be used as a standard loop clips.<br /><br />You can download a fully functional watermarked demo (all the wavs present in the asset with a voiceover) <a href=\"http://www.alchemystudio.it/Musica/GameLibrary/Unreal/Adaptive_music_Unreal_demo.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.",
