  "description": "Monster and Creature sounds that will separate your game from others! This sound pack offers quality over quantity. Multiple voice variations for each creature are provided for best results in realism. From small and creepy, to big and mean!",
  "longDescription": "<p><u>UPDATE 1: 46 Attack Sound Effects for when the creatures strikes!</u></p><p><br /></p><ul><li>The sounds were designed in multiple variations so that it doesn&#39;t get tiring to hear them over and over again. With a few simple settings in your game engine, you can rotate samples and make a huge difference.</li><li>Unlike many others, we preserved the high frequencies in the sound so that they could cut through any environment, on any speaker system. Creating these was more than just pitching down animal recordings and calling it a day!</li><li>No reverb was applied. This means you&#39;re free to choose your reverb settings to match the environment where your creature is living. It may be a forest, a cave, a street, or a phone booth where your action is taking place.</li><li>Updated with 46 SFX for when the creature charges or attacks the player.</li></ul><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cyberwave-orchestra/sets/sci-fi-monsters-and-creatures?utm_source&#61;clipboard&amp;utm_medium&#61;text&amp;utm_campaign&#61;social_sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">SoundCloud Preview</a></p><p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mfu4-DO2VtG_R0Isl5bnXzdpkO1WL69f/view?usp&#61;share_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">View Files List Here</a></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><ul><li><em>We appreciate hearing from our buyers and value your feedback!
