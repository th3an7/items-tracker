  "longDescription": "July 12, 2018, Epic Games announced that creators on the Unreal Engine Marketplace store will now receive 88% of their product sales, an increase from the 70%/30% split.  In addition to implementing the policy for future sales, Epic is paying out all Marketplace publishers retroactively, applying the more creator-friendly 88% rate to previous transactions dating back to the storeâ€™s 2014 launch.  A one-time retroactive payment of 18% of seller's gross revenue from all sales that occurred between August 2014 and May 2018, will be deposited to seller's bank account or PayPal account on August 15th, 2018.\n\nThis offer is used to display retroactive payout info in the seller's payout report.",
