  "longDescription": "<p>This pack is intended to give the extra push your game needs to make its environments feel totally alien to the player. Included are 65 rune images, all imported from 512 by 512 pixel .png files, that can be used in decals, user interfaces, etc. The pack includes a Blueprint function library, that contains a function for mapping string characters to glyph images. The included Blueprint widget and decal actor make use of this, converting configurable text into runes. Because real text is being used, the runes won’t seem ‘too random’ and the players will never doubt that there is meaning, even if they don’t know what it is. The Blueprint decal actor has parameters for color and size, making for easy placement. There are two included decal materials to choose from. One has a flat look, while the other has a raised edges effect.</p>",
