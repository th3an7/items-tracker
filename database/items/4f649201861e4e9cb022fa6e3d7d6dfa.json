  "description": "Modular music components with dynamic layers. Includes music system BPs using Quartz and MetaSounds.",
  "longDescription": "<p><strong>New for UE5! </strong>Music implementation Blueprints have been rebuilt entirely from the ground up using Quartz and MetaSounds. These features provide greater precision and eliminate the reliance upon sound cues. (Note: Quartz and MetaSounds are still in beta. MetaSounds plugin must be activated in your project&#39;s plugin settings.)</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Caravan: Frontier Fantasy</strong> is a collection of modular loops and stingers designed for maximum customization and reusability. The music has a frontier fantasy style using orchestral instruments, choir, and featured soloists.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://play.reelcrafter.com/syzygysound/caravan-frontier-fantasy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Track Previews</a> | <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1exwfOy3Deup67ZTcDnQPV1CjtNdtSnhWZOwEArY2rzA/edit?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Documentation</a> (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eZ6FQiDYcAnX-psd8cLoZpA58Im9iURcdSV3WbRNies/edit?usp&#61;sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">UE4</a>) | <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;fAnoWphUARU\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video Walkthrough</a></p><p><br /></p><p>There are <strong>six core tracks</strong>. Each of the tracks are broken into smaller components that can be rearranged in many different permutations. Cues can be curated into a desired play-order, randomized, or controlled by branching logic. Information for all components can be found in the documentation.</p><p><br /></p><p>Almost all cue components are comprised of <strong>5-9 instrument layers</strong> that can be controlled independently for additional dynamic variation. Adding or removing layers allows the same music to be used in many different contexts without sounding exactly the same. Very different moods can be achieved by using different layers.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Includes Syzygy Music System example implementation. </strong>The Syzygy Music System is a flexible music sequencer specifically tailored for Syzygy Sound music packs, but can also accommodate music of similar design. Curated and randomized examples of modular implementation are included. Open the test level to listen to the music and play around with the different events.</p>",
