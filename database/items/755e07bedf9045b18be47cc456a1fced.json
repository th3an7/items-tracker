The <strong>HUGE</strong> collection of <strong>54 loops</strong> gives you <strong>full creative control</strong> over the music in your gaming product, like having the music producer in your back pocket, the same way as TV/Film producers and directors do.</p><p><br /></p><p>&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;</p><p><strong>MASSIVE CONTENT</strong></p><p>&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;</p><p><br /></p><p>From <strong>12 original genuine artistic tracks,</strong> written by <strong>Pro Composers</strong> and all featuring <strong>Live Instruments</strong>, there are<strong> 142 </strong>Musical Elements for your project, including <strong>54</strong> seamless loops, with a massive <strong>4 hours</strong> of play time! These can be used for different levels, menu screens, cutaways, and expansion content. </p><p><br /></p><p>&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;</p><p><strong>ADAPTABLE AND VERSATILE</strong></p><p>&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;</p><p><br /></p><p>It’s likely the game you’re planning has different textures in different levels, dark ambient tones needed in some spaces, more mysterious melodies in others, then this pack gives you <strong>54 1-3 minute loops</strong> to accomplish that. You can fill the still void of a menu screen with more melodic track versions, cut to a “pad only” mix in a different level to give a different feel. </p><p><br /></p><p>You have many options rather than just using the individual tracks supplied in the pack. This means you have more choices to get the exact sound that you want for the game you’re creating, and you can keep coming back to the pack again for your future releases.</p><p><br /></p><p>&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;</p><p><strong>PRO LEVEL MUSIC, INDIE BUDGET</strong></p><p>&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;&#61;</p><p><br /></p><p>The Music in this Pack has been made by Creators with masses of experience writing <strong>Music for High End Media</strong>, and has already clocked up thousands of hours on television broadcasts all over the world.
