  "description": "A system for sending damage events between actors, and managing the health of an actor with a large number of options, including weak spots, resistances, shields, and more.",
  "longDescription": "<p>Demo Video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;CTPKZnWfZaE&amp;index&#61;17\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;CTPKZnWfZaE&amp;index&#61;17</a></p><p><br /></p><p>The core of this system is the Health_BP actor component, a component that can be dropped into any actor and can manage its health with a large variety of options and in a standardized system. What types of options could you possibly have for health you ask? Well a lot as it turns out. Everything from having spots that take more damage to armor values or elemental resistances or weaknesses, or having multiple health pools on the same actor for different parts of it, or perhaps with one acting as a shield while the other is the underlying health. This component allows you to create a number of Health Elements on a single component that can each allow for their own unique values on how they behave or interact with other Health Elements or the parent actor. Simply tell it what part of the actor was hit, with how much damage, and with what types of modifiers and this system can take care of the rest. This makes it useful for simple single health bar actors with nothing special about them, to large bosses with layered shielding and multiple destructible parts.</p><p>This package also includes a blueprint interface that allows for a standardized method of sending damage information from one actor to another, with greater detail and options than is allowed by Unreals inbuilt damage system. However the individual parts of this package are open ended enough to allow for you to in most cases tie them into whatever other setups you may have. For the full details on all the options included and exactly how to use this product, please read the documentation.</p>",
