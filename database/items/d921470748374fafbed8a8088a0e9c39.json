  "longDescription": "<p><strong>Important notice!</strong></p><p><strong>I had to fix a small bug, but used 4.26 for that. If you want to fix it in an older version that was previously supported (4.19&#43;), check the documentation (it&#39;s a simple fix, link is in the technical details section). </strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Spice up your dialogues with some animated text and add sound effects per letter. Now featuring &#34;Multitags&#34; and datatables for faster string manipulation and external editing of asset implementation, as well as animated images/flipbook animated sprites.</p><p>Concepted for multiple lines of text. Uses data tables for string input. A public line length variable allows for adaptive text wrapping.</p><p>Text creation speed and the playback speed of animations/pitch of sounds can be sped up/shifted ingame by A buttonpress.</p><p>Now also allows for entering and recalling custom names!</p><p>Demo video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MvVAU6iebbg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/MvVAU6iebbg</a></p><p>Short tutorial on usage: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rsXTDfHaIB8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/rsXTDfHaIB8</a></p><p>Current versions only supports left aligned text (changing alignment in the textbox has no effect).</p><p>built in UE v4.26</p><p><strong>Support topic at forums: </strong><a href=\"https://forums.unrealengine.com/unreal-engine/marketplace/1493098-blueprint-based-animated-text-widgets-for-ui\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://forums.unrealengine.com/unreal-engine/marketplace/1493098-blueprint-based-animated-text-widgets-for-ui</a></p><p><strong>Contact: zugai (at) gmx.at</strong></p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features:</p><ul><li>3 UI widget blueprints for handling the animation of individual letters and images and the script that builds the text blocks from them.</li><li>1 Example Camerashake blueprint</li><li>4 Entrance Animation Examples and</li><li>9 Loop Animation Examples for the animated letters as well as 2 animations for images.</li><li>5 CC0 licensed audio files (freesound.org, GDC sound bundle, modified) to demonstrate implementation of sound per letter and at end of line.</li><li>6 datatables and constructs with assets and test dialogue text with exaggerated use of tags</li><li>4 fonts with a total of 12 typefaces</li><li>background and dialogue box, as well as character images of the promo video.</li><li>also includes a debugger for tags, that will log to output log, if enabled.</li></ul><p>Number of Blueprints: 4</p><p>Input: For testing purpose, pressing enter/LMB will make the UI pop up and skip through the strings, if they are finished displaying, a final press will reset everything. Needs to be implemented the way you want it to react.

Only left aligned text is supported.</p><p><br /></p><p>I&#39;ll look into feature requests on a case by case base.</p><p>It probably works on all platforms, but I can only test it on Windows.
