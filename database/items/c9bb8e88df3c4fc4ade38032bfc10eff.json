Typically these sounds are called fanfares.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Where to use?</strong></p><p>Commonly used to game over, or win a battle in RPG, level up, get a bonus, lose something, there are several different styles in the package, with different tempos, which you can change the pitch to be a little faster or slower.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>How were these sounds made?</strong></p><p>Through virtual instruments in a DAW, using music theory to make these small arrangements give the necessary sensation.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Helping each other</strong></p><p>When you decide to invest in this package you are helping a resource creator to continue creating and still have all these sounds.</p>",
