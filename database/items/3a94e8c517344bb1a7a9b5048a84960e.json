This controller can allow for multiple turrets to be controlled, with specific options governing each ones rates of rotation and the limits of how far it can turn in various directions. It also provides some useful information that can be accessed in the blueprints, such as which turrets are currently facing the targeted location or how far the target location is from a given turret. This is an easy out of the box controller pack to let you make whatever art assets you have quickly become something you can easily rotate to face your targeted location, emphasizing simplicity and ease of use. Be it a tank, battleship, or fortress this blueprint can help you operate your turrets.</p><p><br /></p><p>This controller is also made so it can be deactivated and activated as is needed, be it completely or just for individual turrets. This can allow some turrets to become inactive if destroyed, or possibly controlled by another controller or system if needed.</p><p><br /></p><p>Also included is a camera controller that can control a camera attached to a spring arm in any actor with some simple input events. While included, the turret controller can use any means of camera control you may have.</p><p><br /></p><p>Lastly, there is a Turret art asset included with this packaged.</p><p><br /></p><p>Replication support was added last update.</p>",
