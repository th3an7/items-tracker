  "longDescription": "<p>This plugin consists of two tools: <strong>PoseWrangler</strong> and <strong>Pose Driver Connect</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>PoseWrangler</strong> is a Maya Python tool for interfacing with the <strong>MayaUERBFPlugin</strong>. The RBF plugin allows users to author complex secondary animation in Maya leveraging a driver/driven relationship to smoothly blend between n number of poses or transformations.</p>\n<p>For example, to fix problematic areas of deformation like shoulders, elbows, thighs and knees you can create a list/set of poses and tweak the secondary joint transformations to fix the deformations in each pose.</p>\n<p><strong>PoseWrangler</strong> provides a Python API and user interface to simplify the creation/management of RBF setups and export the RBF data to intermediate files that <strong>Pose Driver Connect</strong> can read inside Unreal.</p>\n<p><strong>Pose Driver Connect</strong> is a C++ Unreal plugin that can take the exported data from <strong>PoseWrangler</strong> and create a network of PoseDrivers in an existing AnimBlueprint which results in secondary deformation that is a one to one match with the deformation authored in Maya.</p>\n<b>UE-Only Content</b> - Licensed for Use Only with Unreal Engine-based Products",
  "technicalDetails": "<p><strong>PoseWrangler Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Supports Maya scenes created with the UERBFSolverNode and provides an upgrade path for older UE4RBFSolverNode scenes.</li><li>Multiple Driver Support</li><li>Support for custom mirror mappings to allow for rigs with naming conventions that deviate from the default UE5 conventions</li><li>Fully automatable via Python and MayaPy</li><li>Serialization/deserialization of RBF parameters to dictionary or JSON file, export poses as FBX.</li><li>Support for custom extensions and context menu actions</li><li>Supports Maya 2020-2023, Python2 &amp; Python3</li></ul><p><strong>How to install PoseWrangler for Maya:</strong></p>\nMarketplace will download PoseDriverConnect.zip to <code>&lt;UE5 install location&gt;\\Engine\\Plugins\\Marketplace\\PoseDriverConnect\\Content</code>\n\n<strong><p>Extract PoseDriverConnect.zip to your maya/modules folder:</p></strong><ul><li>Windows: <code>C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt;\\Documents\\Maya\\modules</code></li><li>Linux: <code>~/maya/modules</code></li></ul>Restart Maya.
