  "description": "Screenwriter is a tool for creating Screenplay, which could be Dynamic Cutscenes, Interactive Character Dialogue or even complete story progression, that can be easily integrated with your existing game systems.",
  "longDescription": "<p><strong>Big Update for UE4.20, see the Developer Notes section!</strong></p><p>Screenwriter is a Code Plugin featuring Actors, Assets Types and a Graph Editor for creating in-game dynamic Cutscenes, Interactive Character Dialogue scenes, and other story-driven gameplay elements.</p><p>The Primary feature is the ability to implement “Acts” for your game, using the Act asset and its associated supporting types. </p><p>Acts are an analogue to an Act in Screenplay, being a scripted sequence of Actions, such as Characters speaking, playing Animations or world changing events like a building being destroyed.</p><p>The Plugin has a small initial footprint, which is designed to be extended by Gameplay Programmers, to give Designers the power they need in the Game.</p><p>The Graph Editor is built using the same system as Blueprints, giving Designers a familiar environment to Script the game. It allows them to add optional Directions during Actions. Branches allow different sequences of Actions to execute based on dynamic in-game Conditions, and also allow multiple Entry Points into the Act.</p><p><strong><u>Example Videos:</u></strong></p><p>These videos demonstrate some possible uses of the Plugin. The implementations are included for free in the Example Project linked to in the Technical Information.</p><p><strong>Dialogue Scene:</strong> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zPfuh2cKylg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/zPfuh2cKylg</a></p><p><strong>Branching Scripted Scene:</strong> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vbpUwiG_6yw\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/vbpUwiG_6yw</a></p><p><strong>Cutscene:</strong> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZhglPfqQisc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/ZhglPfqQisc</a></p>",
