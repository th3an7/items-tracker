  "description": "Custom bullet trajectories and damage handling. Done with 3 components, 1 main Data Table and a few Curves",
  "longDescription": "<p>Setup video: https://youtu.be/wwCkBiHeyDI</p><p>Showcase video: https://youtu.be/Gi3_tGq4TOw</p><p>Warning: I am no artist so the showcase isn&#39;t some high-poly weapons but some arrows and boxes instead.</p><p><br /></p><p>Custom bullets and damage handling provides all the necessary components to make some proper gun fights.</p><p><br /></p><p>All bullets are defined in 1 main data table, the way they fly after being fired depends on the values you put into the table (for ray-based bullets). Any trajectory can be achieved with the right adjustment to the Vertical and Horizontal axis Curves. Bullet speed is also Curve based - yes the bullet can go forward then backwards and again forward at your will! Ever wanted to make a gun that when shot forward hits the person behind? Well now you can! (Without sitting hours on the math side of things, I already covered that for you)</p><p><br /></p><p>I cover most of the features in the video and if you want to see how it works you can have a look, comments are literally in every single blueprint so if you don&#39;t have the smallest idea how such a thing could work, you will get the idea once you read through and if you don&#39;t then you can always ask.</p><p><br /></p><p>The bullets are good but kinda boring if they don&#39;t do anything after hitting the target and here comes the Damage Handling. You make the bullet (it can be any actor, with or without a mesh), give it 1 component then give 1 component to the actor that is supposed to shoot them and finally you give 1 component to whatever you want to damage and it works like a charm. Curves define many things and damage is no exception - you can make the damage falloff be what you want it to be. </p>",
  "technicalDetails": "<p>Features:</p><ul><li>Only 3 components</li><li>Simple implementation</li><li>No limits to bullet trajectory </li><li>Built-in damage handling</li><li>Works with multiplayer</li><li>Optimized - hundreds of ray based bullets possible (without mesh so draw calls are not the problem)</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Number of Blueprints: 8 (3 main components, 5 example bullets and some additional ones for the examples)</p><p>Network Replicated: Yes</p><p>Supported Development Platforms: Made on PC, should work on any platform</p><p>Supported Target Build Platforms: All platforms, no usage of platform specific features</p><p>Documentation: All Blueprints are well documented, the video shows the setup process, examples are included and online docs over here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nM6SoEuwUkd_lGX2GSQJylhTVI4MSKUZV4P5TqqXo_c/edit?usp&#61;sharing</p><p>Important/Additional Notes: I&#39;m open for feature requests, ask and you will probably receive.</p>",
